Hi,

I'm very interested in the position. You can find my resume at https://joegallo.nyc/.

Best,

I donâ€™t do diners. Diners are a mediocre waste of time.

Please understand my existence.
I can't be poor and I can't be rich. I'm just this mediocre middle class piece of shit.

What if reincarnation was like an infinity symbol with life and death at the center
and the loops got shorter and shorter with each iteration so that you reincarnated
as something with a shorter lifespan a la telomere shortening, so it was in your
best interest to make the world a better place hopefully to make your future lives
better/longer.

Dear FBI Director,

I know you're busy fighting crime but personally I think this is a top priority. Someone has left a stale bread on my garden hose. (No this is
not a euphemism for terrible sex). I've included said piece of stale bread for DNA analysis. If you would be so kind as to test it and write
back as soon as you can, that would be great. Feel free to disregard this letter if the DNA results come back showing it belongs
to a seagull as I think we both can agree they're assholes and this kind of behavior can be expected from them.

Sincerely,
Joe

movie plot:
We need to get to the bottom of this lizard people problem. I need you agents to infiltrate mental health hospitals across the country
and see what you can dig up.

interview assignment
====
two parts

1) build
grab json from a url you have control over
load it into a collection view
specify layout specs that would require overriding collection view layout methods (minimumInter...)
tapping into collection view shows very basic detail view

2) debug
change some of the code they submit
change some of the json returned by the url

key things to mention on giving the assignment (controversial)
  "Treat this as the beginning of a large project as opposed to a one-off assignment."

Random story to fill in for my lack of interesting photos and overall terrible profile:

One day I'm hanging out in my apartment (2nd floor, facing the street) and I hear my landlord outside talking to someone. I'm watching a movie with the lights off and as I walk into my bedroom I see she's talking to two cops and one of them suddenly says they see movement in the apartment. They then enter the building and at this point I know some stupid shit is about to go down. Sure enough they knock on my door yelling "Police, open up!" I open up the door to two cops, guns drawn in my general direction, and all I can think of to say is "Hey, what's up?" to which the cops' reaction is a sigh of relief that they don't have to shoot someone and a "Jesus Christ, Barbara, you said no one was home." Turns out my landlord heard reports of someone trying to break into the building, knocked on every apartment earlier in the day and I wasn't home so when they saw me moving around in the dark they assumed I was breaking into my own place. My one Alex Honnold moment.

The worst part about finding an apartment is having to deal with fucking retards like yourself.
You make up to thirty thousand a month. You should be a little more competent than this.
