You could just spam people with dirty wire transfers since the people don't need to accept and then the FBI would be pissed.

Jim, I'm about to travel back in time. I'll call you back.

cop: What are you doing?
me: Hunting for schizophrenics.

Dear FBI Director,

I know you're busy fighting crime but personally I think this is a top priority. Someone has left a stale bread on my garden hose. (No this is
not a euphemism for terrible sex). I've included said piece of stale bread for DNA analysis. If you would be so kind as to test it and write
back as soon as you can, that would be great. Feel free to disregard this letter if the DNA results come back showing it belongs
to a seagull as I think we both can agree they're assholes and this kind of behavior can be expected from them.

Sincerely,
Joe

What if reincarnation was like an infinity symbol with life and death at the center
and the loops got shorter and shorter with each iteration so that you reincarnated
as something with a shorter lifespan a la telomere shortening, so it was in your
best interest to make the world a better place hopefully to make your future lives
better/longer.

movie plot:
We need to get to the bottom of this lizard people problem. I need you agents to infiltrate mental health hospitals across the country
and see what you can dig up.

interview assignment
  two parts

  1) build
  grab json from a url you have control over
  load it into a collection view
  specify layout specs that would require overriding collection view layout methods (minimumInter...)
  tapping into collection view shows very basic detail view

  2) debug
  change some of the code they submit
  change some of the json returned by the url

  key things to mention on giving the assignment
    Treat this as the beginning of a large project as opposed to a one-off assignment.
