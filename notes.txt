no good men among the living
============================
before the soviet union invaded afghanistan, it was a pretty progressive hippie friendly place (communists) [1950s]
April 1978: Communists rally against government [under dictator Daud Khan] for killing leader Mir Akbar Khyber
Communists stage coup, kill Khan
Christmas Eve 1979: Soviets invade
Even before the soviets invaded, it was pretty much the Muslim Brotherhood [in the outskirts] and the Communists
once soviets invade, the Islamist insurgents (mujahadeen) unite against soviets
soviets vs. us, pakistan, saudi arabia
afghani boys educated in pakistan and fed extreme violent version of islam
soviets withdraw in 1989
soviet union collapses in 1991, aid to proxies ceases, afghan government collapses
mujahadeen take over
commander in northwestern province of Faryab decrees it permissable to rape any unmarried girl over the age of 12
1992: afghan civil war begins
two rival groups: Islamic Society, Islamic Party
Islamic Society led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, including general Ahmad Shah Massoud
Islamic Party led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
group of militiamen christened "Gelam Jam" (Rug Collectors) for looting everything
1993: Moussad allies with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf
Feb 7, 1993: Massoud and Sayyaf's forces attack Afshar
Sayyaf would later invite Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan
practice of seclusion (purdah) of women predates Islam
throughout history of Afghanistan, tribal policy went from egalitarian to hierarchical through strongmen, to sharia
main practitioners of sharia were mullahs
to become a mullah you studied for up to 12 years in a madrassa
in Pashto, these students were called taliban

2 hex characters = 1 byte

cell phone simulators
=====================
Harris: Triggerfish -> StingRay -> Hailstorm
countermeasures: Android:SnoopSnitch, ESD:CryptoPhone
In theory IMSI catchers can pinpoint only the location of 3G/4G phones so the trick is to knock them down to 2G to access calls/texts/etc., which is what Hailstorm does.

caduceus vs rod of asclepius
============================
The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, eloquence, trickery, and negotiation.
Tangential association of the caduceus with medicine has occurred through the ages, where it was sometimes associated with alchemy and wisdom.
The modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.

limitless worker surveillance
=============================
in Feb 1855 Allan Pinkerton met with attorney Edward Rucker at Chicago Masonic Hall to discuss need for greater control over employees
they decided to form Pinkerton National Detective Agency
The Pinkertons served role of infiltrating/busting unions and monitoring workers
Congress later passes Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 which limited federal government's ability to hire Pinkertons (private employers still could)

why zebras don't get ulcers
===========================
Walter Cannon focused on adaptive aspect of stress-response in dealing with emergencies
Hans Selye formalized the ill effects of stress with ulcerated rat experiment
autonomic nervous system includes sympathetic and parasympathetic systems
sympathetic: fight, flight, fright, sex
parasympathetic: chill
"safety features" exist so that parts of the brain that trigger sympathetic inhibit the parasympathetic and vice versa
neural route represented by sympathetic system is first means to mobilize response to stressor
another way is through secretion of hormones
if a neuron secretes a chemical messenger that travels and causes next cell in line to do something different, that messenger is a neurotransmitter
if a neuron secretes a messenger that instead percolates into the bloodstream, that messenger is a hormone
used to be believed that testicles secrete less testosterone with age
wealthy people would get injected with testicular extracts from other animals [and could even pick the animal]
this led to organotherapy: grafting of little bits of testes
in 1944 Geoffrey Harris proposes that brain is also a hormonal gland
Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally start looking for these brain hormones
14 years later, the chemical structure of the first releasing hormone is published
they get the Nobel Price in 1976
the hypothalamus contains a huge array of releasing and inhibiting hormones
two hormones vital to stress-response are epinephrine and norepinephrine released by sympathetic nervous system
another important class of hormones in response to stress are glucocorticoids
glucocorticoids are steroid hormones
steroid is used to describe general chemical structure of five classes of hormones: androgens (anabolic), estrogens, progestins, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids
secreted by the adrenal gland, often act similar to epinephrine
epinephrine acts within seconds, glucocorticoids back this up over course of minutes or hours
a putative hormone is referred to as a factor until its chemical structure is confirmed (ex: CRF -> CRH)
CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) triggers pituitary to release hormone ACTH (corticotropin)
ACTH is released into bloodstream, reaches adrenal gland, and triggers glucocorticoid release
in times of stress pancreas is stimulated to release hormone glucagon
glucocorticoids, glucagon, and the sympathetic nervous system raise circulating levels of sugar glucose
pituitary also secretes prolactin, which suppresses reproduction during stress
pituitary and brain secrete class of endogenous morphine-like substances called endorphins and enkephalins which help blunt pain perception
pituitary also secretes vasopressin, aka antidiuretic hormone, which plays role in cardiovascular stress-response
sympathetic arousal is a relative marker of anxiety and vigilance
heavy secretion of glucocorticoids is more a marker of depression

the innovators
==============
ada byron (=> lovelace) daughter of poet lord byron
ada lovelace meets charles babbage
charles babbage builds a Difference Engine, which can solve polynomial equations
at Cambridge, Babbage along with John Herschel and George Peacock form a club called Analytical Society
Analytical Society campaigned to get university to abandon Newton's dot notation calculus and replace with Leibniz' dx/dy notation
in 1640s, Blaise Pascal created mechanical calculator for tax purposes
Leibniz tries to improve it with multiplication/division (does not completely succeed due to not being an engineer)
Babbage and hired engineer not quite skilled enough to get Difference Engine working
Babbage dreams up something else: The Analytical Machine
Analytical Machine is the product of what Ada Lovelace, in her essay on imagination, called "the Combining Faculty"
Babbage applies the automated loom, invited in 1801 by Joseph-Marie Jacquard
Babbage unable to get funding from British government
Babbage meets future prime minister of Italy Menabrea who publishes description of Analytical Machine in French
ada adds translation and "Notes by the Translator"; the notes become more famous than the article itself
notes make ada destined to become iconic figure in history of computing
in ada's notes she explores 4 concepts
1) a general-purpose machine, one that could perform a preset task but could be programmed and reprogrammed to do limitless and changeable array of tasks
2) the machine could store, manipulate, process, and act upon anything that could be expressed in symbols
3) figure out in step-by-step detail the workings of a program/algorithm (used Bernoulli numbers as example)
4) machines cannot think (later dubbed "Lady Lovelace's Objection" by Alan Turing)
babbage wanted ada to push the govt for funding
ada refuses, babbage then writes an attack against govt and cowardly asks ada to include it in her notes
babbage sends appendage anyway and they reply telling him to man up and submit it separately with his name
babbage asks ada not to send her notes; she refuses and he backs down and submits it separately
ada offers babbage a business/political partnership; he declines
herman hollerith, an employee of the us census bureau, annoyed it took almost 8 years to manually tabulate 1880 census
hollerith gets idea of rail conductors punching holes on ticket
using the punch cards, hollerith completes 1890 census in a year
first major use of electrical circuits to process info
hollerith founds company in 1924: -> (mergers, aquisitions) -> International Business Machines (IBM)
machines by Hollerith and Babbage were digital: calculated using digits
another approach is to model a physical phenomenon and make measurements on analogous model to calculate results: analog machine
Lord Kelvin and James Thomson worked on creating an analog machine to solve diferential equations
used to help create tide charts and artillery trajectory tables
analog machine used a planimeter that can measure area of two-dimensional shape
able to produce tide chart in four hours, but unable to link devices together to solve multivariable eqns
multivariable eqn problem finally mastered in 1931 by Vanevar Bush with his Differential Analyzer; he will later found Raytheon
Differential Analyzer very useful for artillery firing tables
in mid 1930s Tommy Flowers pioneers use of vacuum tubes as on-off switch in electronic circuits
Alan Turing wins scholarship to attend King's College to read mathematics
one of three books he buys with prize money is John vom Neumann's The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
at 1928 conference, Hilbert poses three fundamental questions about any formal system of mathematics
1) was its set of rules complete so that any statement could be proved/disproved using only rules of system?
2) was it consistent so that no statement could be proved true and also proved false?
3) was there some procedure that could determine whether a particular statement was provable, rather than allowing some statement to be unprovable?
within 3 years kurt godel answered first two questions with a no
his incompleteness theorem used self-referential statements
Turing's teacher Max Newman teaches Turing about Hilbert's questions
Turing comes up with Logical Computing Machine as thought experiment
Logical Computing Machine: infinite length of paper tape containing symbols within squares; machine reads symbols and performs actions based on instructions table
Turing went on to show that noncomputable numbers existed, related to the halting problem
halting problem: there can be no method to determine in advance whether any given instruction table combined with inputs will run indefinitely
thus: no mechanical procedure can detrmine the provability of every mathematical statement
Turing's paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" published in 1937
Max Newman sends Turing off to Princeton to study under Alonzo Church
Turing's paper doesn't get much attention
Turing asks mother to send out reprints to Bertrand Russell and some other scholars
only major review is done by Alonzo Church who introduces the term Turing Machine
Claude Shannon applies Boole logic for electrical circuits
relay: a switch that can be opened/shut electrically using an electromagnet
ones that clack open/closed sometimes called electromechanical because they have moving parts
vacuum tubes and transistors can be used as switches in electrical circuits; they're called electronic since they manipulate flow of electrons but do not require movement of physical parts
logic gate: switch that can handle one or more inputs
George Stibitz was working at Bell Labs around same time; uses relays and bulbs to show you could create a calculating machine with them
Bell Labs needed to amplify a phone signal over long distance while filtering out static
solution involved complex numbers
Stibitz gets chance to build machine to help => The Complex Number Calculator completed in 1939
Howard Aiken lobbies Harvard to build a more sophisticated computer to help with calculations
Harvard Mark I built under Howard Aiken after project control transferred to Navy
Mark I was slower but fully automatic
in 1937 Konrad Zuse in Germany builds binary calculator that can read instructions from punched tape
through various prototypes, with Z3 being the first fully working all-purpose programmable digital computer
Zuse's prototypes destroyed in allied bombing of Berlin
John Vincent Atanasoff in Iowa built a calculating device that used vacuum tubes (conceived first partly electronic digital computer)
Atanasoff worked with Clifford Berry
Atanasoff drafted into Navy and work stopped
John Mauchly meets Atanasoff and later builds ENIAC with Eckert (legal dispute ensues)
Turing works at Bletchley Park
Grace Hopper, Jean Jennings, and other women program the ENIAC
John von Neumann improves on ENIAC and essentially gets all credit for it
Mauchly and Eckert leave to form Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation -> Rand -> Unisys; they built UNIVAC which is purchased by Census Bureau
von Neumann returns to Princeton and works on a stored program computer
Neumann leaves to join Atomic Energy Commission and group dissolves; this leads to shift of innovation to corporate realm beginning in 1950s
William Shockley leads team at Bell Labs
Bell Labs sets out to deelop vacuum tube replacement using semiconductors
included in the group are John Bardeen and Walter Brattain
Bardeen and Brattain come up with transistor
Shockley is jealous and pushes himself to one-up them with an improvement (layering of materials)
Pat Haggerty of Texas Instruments has trouble licensing tech from Bell Labs
Haggerty hires away Gordon Teal, they build the transistor radio; pocket radio is a huge hit
Shockley looks to build a transistor company
Shockley and Beckman look to start company in Palo Alto
Palo Alto population increases due to work from defense industry
film canisters dropped from U-2 spy planes were developed at NASA Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale; people flock to the area
Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett start out in a garage in the area; by the 1950s, Hewlett-Packard becomes pace horse for region's tech startups
Fred Ternan, student of Vannevar Bush at MIT, becomes Stanford dean of engineering and creates industrial park in 1953
Ternan woos Shockley who moves Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, a division of Beckman Instruments, to Stanford
Shockley hires Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and the other "traitorous eight"
Shockley becomes insufferable and the traitorous eight leave to form Fairchild Semiconductor
Shockley Semiconductor never recovers, Shockley leaves for Stanford
on October 4, 1957, Russians launch Sputnik, setting off a space race
Jack Kilby joins Texas Instruments; builds the first microchip
Jean Hoerni, a Fairchild physicist places a layer of silicon oxide to protect the transistor
Noyce and Moore start looking into making multiple devices on single piece of silicon
patent battle ensues between Texas Instruments and Fairchild
even if texas instruments were to be awarded a patent for putting multiple components on a single chip, Fairchild hoped to be awarded a patent for making the connections through printed metal lines instead of wires
in April 1961 Noyce was declared the inventor of the microchip
some legal confusion later and Kilby granted patent
Fairchild appeals and wins
Fairchild and Texas Instruments come to a truce and agree to co-license to each other
Kilby and Noyce seen as coinventors
first major market for microchips is military
in 1962 Strategic Air Command designed land-based missile Minuteman II that required two thousands microchips just on onboard guidance system
Navy also buying chips for submarine-launched missile Polaris
first consumer devices to use microchips are hearing aids
Texas Instruments starts working on pocket calculators
fairchild camera and instrument buy fairchild semiconductor and stifle creativity
many leave; Jean Hoerni and 3 others leave to start Teledyne funded by Arthur Rock
Arthur Rock provided venture capital for Fairchild Semiconductor deal
more VCs: Venrock Associates, American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC)
ARDC founded by Georges Doriot, former dean of Harvard Business School
Arthur Rock placed value on people rather than idea
Noyce and Moore form Intel
west coast work style starts with Hewlett-Packard (laid back, flexible hours, etc.)
Andy Grove, who also worked at Fairchild, joins Intel as director of engineering
in summer 1969 japanese company Busicom go to Intel to build powerful desktop calculator
in sep 1969 Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor design a general purpose logic chip
intel retains rights to new chip and is allowed to license its use to other companies
new chip is basically a computer processor on a chip and is dubbed a microprocessor
in nov 1971, intel releases new chip to public as the Intel 4004
Don Hoefler, a columnist for the weekly trade paper Electronic News, starts series of columns titled "Silicon Valley USA"
hacker subculture as well as video game Spacewar comes from MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club

DEC PDP-1 donated to MIT in Sept 1961
best programmer in the group is Steve Russell who helped John McCarthy create LISP
Nolan Bushnell huge Spacewar fan
Nolan Bushnell gets into University of Utah, which has best computer graphics program in the country at the time
University of Utah one of four nodes on ARPANET
other U of U students included Jim Clark (Netscape), John Warnock (Adobe), Ed Catmull (Pixar), and Alan Kay
Atari incorporated June 27, 1972
Congress established National Science Foundation based on Vanevar Bush's report titled "Science, the Endless Frontier"
Defense Department and National Science Foundation become prime funders of much of America's basic research
most notable hybrid research centers to pop up after Bush's push are:
  RAND Corporation, originally formed to provide rsearch and development to Air Force
  Stanford Research Insitute and its offshoot, the Augmentation Research Center
  Xerox PARC
  Lincoln Laboratory, military-funded research center affiliated with MIT
  Bolt, Beranek and Newman, founded by MIT, Harvard engineers
J. C. R. Licklider founding director of military office that funded ARPANET; essentially a father of the Internet
Licklider worked with Prof Norbert Wiener, a theorist who coined the term cybernetics
Licklider really good at finding talented people to work with one another
in the 1950s MIT AI lab develop computer time-sharing
DARPA has repeatedly lost the D: created in 1958 as ARPA, renamed DARPA in 1972, ARPA in 1993, back to DARPA in 1996
Licklider comes up with idea for "Libraries of the Future"
Licklider recruited to DC to head information processing at DARPA
Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts worked at ARPA (not on friendly terms)
work on ARPA networking project begins, which is eventually named ARPA Net -> ARPANET by Larry Roberts at a conference: Oct 1967
Roger Scantlebury comes up with idea to break messages into small units called packets
the packet idea had been developed independently by Paul Baran at RAND
different methods for sending data through a network:
  circuit switching: similar to a phone system, a set of switches creates a dedicated circuit for signals to go back and forth during conversation and connection remains open
  message switching (aka store-and-forward switching): entire message given address header, sent into network, then passed along from node to node
  packet switching: messages broken into packets, given address headers, then sent to their destinations
Leonard Kleinrock claims credit for packet stuff, other internet founders kinda flip out at such a claim
Larry Roberts sent out soliciation for bids to companies that might want to build the minicomputers that would be sent to each research center to build the minicomputers
contract goes to BBN, team led by Frank Heart and Robert Kahn
Roberts selects four research centers to be the first ARPANET nodes: UCLA, Stanford Research Lab, University of Utah, and UCSB
UCLA grad student Stephen Crocker leads group of grad students on figuring out how their host computers will connect to the standardized ARPANET IMPs
Crocker comes up with idea for 'Request for Comments' or RFC
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) wanted local-area network to connect office work stations
recent Harvard PhD Bob Metcalfe created way to use coaxial cable to create high-bandwidth system that he named "Ethernet"
it was modeled on wireless network developed in Hawaii called ALOHAnet which sent packet data through UHF and satellite signals
there was a packet radio network in San Francisco called PRNET with a satellite version called SATNET
these systems were not compatible so in 1973 Robert Kahn set out to fix that
Kahn worked with Vint Cerf to work on system that was referred to as an "internetwork" later shortened to "internet"
traffic between ARPANET and any other network had to be seamless; they came up with an Internet Protocol (IP) that specified how to put the packet's destination in its header and helped determine how it would travel through networks to get there
layered above the IP was Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that instructed how to put the packets back together in the right order, checked to see if any of them were missing and requested retransmission of any info that had been lost
in July 1945 Vannevar Bush wrote essay for Atlantic titled "As We May Thing" foreseeing a personal machine he dubbed a memex
ken kesey graduates from university of oregon, goes to bay area as gard student in stanford's creative writing program
while there he worked overnight shift at mental hospital and volunted for projects like Project MKUltra
he writes his first novel One Flow Over the Cuckoo's Nest
forms Merry Pranksters commune and travels cross-country in an old school bus
he starts hosting series of Acid Tests; Kesey hears Grateful Dead and enlists them
stewart brand creates Whole Earth Catalog
Doug Engelbart seeks to augment human intelligence
with some funding, he creates his own Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
Engelbart, along with Bill English, invent the mouse
culminating in 1968, Engelbart devices augmentation system called oNLine System or NLS which included: on-screen graphics, multiple windows on a screen, digital publishing, blog-like journals, wiki-like collaborations, document sharing, email, instant messaging, hypertext linking, skype-like videoconferencing, and formatting of documents
these ideas would later be advanced by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC
Engelbart demos The Mother of All Demos on Dec 9, 1968
Alan Kay joins Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) run by John McCarthy; isn't a good fit
Kay joins Xerox PARC and eventually works on creating the laptop (initially called Dynabook); he creates Smalltalk for the OS software
personal computer never takes of at PARC due to its conversative ways (management)
Fred Moore and friends open a public-access computer center
Lee Felsenstein works on applying tech for societal good (protests, wikipedia-like openness, etc.)
Fred Moore and Gordon French start Homebrew Computer Club
Les Solomon of Popular Electronics discovers MITS (Ed Roberts' company)
Ed Roberts creates the Altair
Steve Dompier plays Beatles song, and then Daisy Bell (first song ever played by a computer at Bell Labs on IBM 704 in 1961) on Altair
Bill Gates and Paul Allen work on BASIC for Altair
Microsoft later formed
Gates writes letter to hobbyists after copies of BASIC are made
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs get together, build blue box and then personal computer; form Apple
Dan Bricklin creates VisiCalc
during 1970s IBM dominated mainframe market with 360 series
DEC and Wang dominated refrigerator-size minicomputer market
IBM approaches Microsoft for OS
Gary Kildall, owner of CP/M, misses opportunity so Microsoft says they'll take care of it, buys DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products
Apple/Microsoft conflict
Richard Stallman creates GNU
Linus Torvalds creates Linux
in 1981 Lawrence Landweber at University of Wisconsin brought together universities not connected to ARPANET and created another network called CSNET
CSNET became forerunner of network funded by NSF: NSFNET
email becomes popular use case on ARPANET
program called SNDMSG allowed user of big central computer to send message to personal folder of another user sharing same computer
in 1971 Ray Tomlinson, an MIT engineer working at BBN, allowed to send messages to folders on other mainframes
he did it by combining SNDMSG with experimental file transfer program called CYPNET; using username@hostname address syntax
in Feb 1978, two members of Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists' Exchange, Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, snowed in by blizzard, develop Bulletin Board System (BBS) for sharing
in 1979 students at Duke and UNC develop system hosted on personal computers known as Usenet
modems introduced for consumer use to connect computers to internet via phone line
illegal to connect modem into phone system electronically but you could do so mechanically
Pennywhistle, designed by Lee Felsenstein, could send/receive digital signals at 300 bps
in 1981 the Hayes Smartmodem came on the market
Stewart Brand helps create The WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link'), an online community to discuss whatever
participants could not be totally anonymous
William von Meister creates The Source, linking home computers into a networking offering bunch of services, one of first consumer-oriented online services
competitor is CompuServe, a business-oriented time-sharing network
in 1984 CBS, Sears, and IBM join forces to launch service Prodigy
up until 1992 it was illegal to connect a commercial service like AOL to the Internet
in September 1993 AOL opens portal allowing members access to newsgroups and bulletin boards of the Internet
the tech savvy referred to this as the Eternal September
Al Gore helped allow AOL to connect to the Internet with the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 and the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992
Tim Berners-Lee creates relational program Enquire at CERN
using hypertext and RPCs he comes up with URLs, HTTP, HTML
