interview assignment
====
two parts

1) build
grab json from a url you have control over
load it into a collection view
specify layout specs that would require overriding collection view layout methods (minimumInter...)
tapping into collection view shows very basic detail view

2) debug
change some of the code they submit
change some of the json returned by the url

key things to mention on giving the assignment:
  "Treat this as the beginning of a large project as opposed to a one-off assignment."

linux
====
3 main layers
  user-space
    applications

  kernel-space
    system call interface
    kernel subsystems
    device drivers

  hardware

each processor doing 1 of 3 things at any given moment:
  * in user-space, executing user code in a process
  * in kernel-space, in process context, executing on behalf of a specific process
  * in kernel-space, in interrupt context, not associated with process, handling an interrupt

major.minor.revision.stable (ex: 2.6.26.1)
minor odd -> development
minor even -> stable

kernel does not have access to libc or standard headers
kernel has its own equivalent of functions (ex: printk instead of printf)

use of inline functions for performance optimization (use sparingly; ex: static inline void wolf(unsigned long tail_size) )
use of inline assembly
branch annotation (ex: unlikely(error), likely(success) )
float point discouraged in kernel
small, fixed-size stack

task list: circular doubly linked list
each element is a process descriptor of type struct task_struct {
  unsigned long state
  int prio
  struct task_struct *parent
  struct list_head tasks
  pid
  ...
}
task_struct allocated via slab allocator
at the end of kernel stack of each process is the struct thread_info {
  struct task_struct *task
  struct exec_domain *exec_domain
  __u32 flags
  __u32 status
  __u32 cpu
  int preempt_count
  ...
}
current macro for process descriptor of currently executing task = current_thread_info()->task
process descriptor states
  TASK_RUNNING: process currently running or on runqueue (only state possible for process executing in user-space)
  TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping
  TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping but doesn't wake up when signalled
  __TASK_TRACED: process is being traced
  __TASK_STOPPED: process has stopped; not running and not eligible to run
change task state with set_task_state(task, state)
all processes descendants of init process, whose PID is one
for_each_process() iterates over entire task list

linked list funkiness
list_for_each()
list_for_each_entry()
list_entry()

scheduler classes
  SCHED_NORMAL
    handled by CFS
    CFS uses the scheduler entity struct, struct sched_entity {
      ...
      on_rq
      ...
      vruntime
      ...
    }
    vruntime: amount of time spent running normalized by the number of runnable processes

process priority
  real-time (0 to 99)
  nice (-20 to 19)

CRISPR (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY&feature=youtu.be)
====
bacteriophages (phages), which are a virus, hunt and kill bacteria by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over
the bacteria try to resist but fail most of the time
sometimes bacteria survive the phages and save a part of the virus dna in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR
when the virus attacks again, the bacteria quickly makes an RNA copy from CRISPR and arms protein CAS9
if the bacteria finds a match against the dna of the attacking virus, the DNA from CAS9 is activated and cuts out the virus DNA, protecting it from virus attack
scientists figured out the CRISPR system is programmable

April 1978: Communists rally against government [under dictator Daud Khan] for killing leader Mir Akbar Khyber
Communists stage coup, kill Khan
Christmas Eve 1979: Soviets invade
Even before the soviets invaded, it was pretty much the Muslim Brotherhood [in the outskirts] and the Communists
once soviets invade, the Islamist insurgents (mujahadeen) unite against soviets
soviets vs. us, pakistan, saudi arabia
afghani boys educated in pakistan and fed extreme violent version of islam
soviets withdraw in 1989
soviet union collapses in 1991, aid to proxies ceases, afghan government collapses
mujahadeen take over
commander in northwestern province of Faryab decrees it permissable to rape any unmarried girl over the age of 12
1992: afghan civil war begins
two rival groups: Islamic Society, Islamic Party
Islamic Society led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, including general Ahmad Shah Massoud
Islamic Party led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
group of militiamen christened "Gelam Jam" (Rug Collectors) for looting everything
1993: Moussad allies with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf
Feb 7, 1993: Massoud and Sayyaf's forces attack Afshar
Sayyaf would later invite Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan
practice of seclusion (purdah) of women predates Islam
throughout history of Afghanistan, tribal policy went from egalitarian to hierarchical through strongmen, to sharia
main practitioners of sharia were mullahs
to become a mullah you studied for up to 12 years in a madrassa
in Pashto, these students were called taliban

Harris: Triggerfish -> StingRay -> Hailstorm
countermeasures: Android:SnoopSnitch, ESD:CryptoPhone
In theory IMSI catchers can pinpoint only the location of 3G/4G phones so the trick is to knock them down to 2G to access calls/texts/etc., which is what Hailstorm does.

caduceus vs rod of asclepius
====
The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, eloquence, trickery, and negotiation.
Tangential association of the caduceus with medicine has occurred through the ages, where it was sometimes associated with alchemy and wisdom.
The modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.

limitless worker surveillance
====
in Feb 1855 Allan Pinkerton met with attorney Edward Rucker at Chicago Masonic Hall to discuss need for greater control over employees
they decided to form Pinkerton National Detective Agency
The Pinkertons served role of infiltrating/busting unions and monitoring workers
Congress later passes Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 which limited federal government's ability to hire Pinkertons (private employers still could)

why zebras don't get ulcers
====
Walter Cannon focused on adaptive aspect of stress-response in dealing with emergencies
Hans Selye formalized the ill effects of stress with ulcerated rat experiment
autonomic nervous system includes sympathetic and parasympathetic systems
sympathetic: fight, flight, fright, sex
parasympathetic: chill
"safety features" exist so that parts of the brain that trigger sympathetic inhibit the parasympathetic and vice versa
neural route represented by sympathetic system is first means to mobilize response to stressor
another way is through secretion of hormones
if a neuron secretes a chemical messenger that travels and causes next cell in line to do something different, that messenger is a neurotransmitter
if a neuron secretes a messenger that instead percolates into the bloodstream, that messenger is a hormone
used to be believed that testicles secrete less testosterone with age
wealthy people would get injected with testicular extracts from other animals [and could even pick the animal]
this led to organotherapy: grafting of little bits of testes
in 1944 Geoffrey Harris proposes that brain is also a hormonal gland
Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally start looking for these brain hormones
14 years later, the chemical structure of the first releasing hormone is published
they get the Nobel Price in 1976
the hypothalamus contains a huge array of releasing and inhibiting hormones
two hormones vital to stress-response are epinephrine and norepinephrine released by sympathetic nervous system
another important class of hormones in response to stress are glucocorticoids
glucocorticoids are steroid hormones
steroid is used to describe general chemical structure of five classes of hormones: androgens (anabolic), estrogens, progestins, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids
secreted by the adrenal gland, often act similar to epinephrine
epinephrine acts within seconds, glucocorticoids back this up over course of minutes or hours
a putative hormone is referred to as a factor until its chemical structure is confirmed (ex: CRF -> CRH)
CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) triggers pituitary to release hormone ACTH (corticotropin)
ACTH is released into bloodstream, reaches adrenal gland, and triggers glucocorticoid release
in times of stress pancreas is stimulated to release hormone glucagon
glucocorticoids, glucagon, and the sympathetic nervous system raise circulating levels of sugar glucose
pituitary also secretes prolactin, which suppresses reproduction during stress
pituitary and brain secrete class of endogenous morphine-like substances called endorphins and enkephalins which help blunt pain perception
pituitary also secretes vasopressin, aka antidiuretic hormone, which plays role in cardiovascular stress-response
sympathetic arousal is a relative marker of anxiety and vigilance
heavy secretion of glucocorticoids is more a marker of depression

The Innovators
====
ada byron (=> lovelace) daughter of poet lord byron
ada lovelace meets charles babbage
charles babbage builds a Difference Engine, which can solve polynomial equations
at Cambridge, Babbage along with John Herschel and George Peacock form a club called Analytical Society
Analytical Society campaigned to get university to abandon Newton's dot notation calculus and replace with Leibniz' dx/dy notation
in 1640s, Blaise Pascal created mechanical calculator for tax purposes
Leibniz tries to improve it with multiplication/division (does not completely succeed due to not being an engineer)
Babbage and hired engineer not quite skilled enough to get Difference Engine working
Babbage dreams up something else: The Analytical Machine
Analytical Machine is the product of what Ada Lovelace, in her essay on imagination, called "the Combining Faculty"
Babbage applies the automated loom, invited in 1801 by Joseph-Marie Jacquard
Babbage unable to get funding from British government
Babbage meets future prime minister of Italy Menabrea who publishes description of Analytical Machine in French
ada adds translation and "Notes by the Translator"; the notes become more famous than the article itself
notes make ada destined to become iconic figure in history of computing
in ada's notes she explores 4 concepts
1) a general-purpose machine, one that could perform a preset task but could be programmed and reprogrammed to do limitless and changeable array of tasks
2) the machine could store, manipulate, process, and act upon anything that could be expressed in symbols
3) figure out in step-by-step detail the workings of a program/algorithm (used Bernoulli numbers as example)
4) machines cannot think (later dubbed "Lady Lovelace's Objection" by Alan Turing)
babbage wanted ada to push the govt for funding
ada refuses, babbage then writes an attack against govt and cowardly asks ada to include it in her notes
babbage sends appendage anyway and they reply telling him to man up and submit it separately with his name
babbage asks ada not to send her notes; she refuses and he backs down and submits it separately
ada offers babbage a business/political partnership; he declines
herman hollerith, an employee of the us census bureau, annoyed it took almost 8 years to manually tabulate 1880 census
hollerith gets idea of rail conductors punching holes on ticket
using the punch cards, hollerith completes 1890 census in a year
first major use of electrical circuits to process info
hollerith founds company in 1924: -> (mergers, aquisitions) -> International Business Machines (IBM)
machines by Hollerith and Babbage were digital: calculated using digits
another approach is to model a physical phenomenon and make measurements on analogous model to calculate results: analog machine
Lord Kelvin and James Thomson worked on creating an analog machine to solve diferential equations
used to help create tide charts and artillery trajectory tables
analog machine used a planimeter that can measure area of two-dimensional shape
able to produce tide chart in four hours, but unable to link devices together to solve multivariable eqns
multivariable eqn problem finally mastered in 1931 by Vanevar Bush with his Differential Analyzer; he will later found Raytheon
Differential Analyzer very useful for artillery firing tables
in mid 1930s Tommy Flowers pioneers use of vacuum tubes as on-off switch in electronic circuits
Alan Turing wins scholarship to attend King's College to read mathematics
one of three books he buys with prize money is John vom Neumann's The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
at 1928 conference, Hilbert poses three fundamental questions about any formal system of mathematics
1) was its set of rules complete so that any statement could be proved/disproved using only rules of system?
2) was it consistent so that no statement could be proved true and also proved false?
3) was there some procedure that could determine whether a particular statement was provable, rather than allowing some statement to be unprovable?
within 3 years kurt godel answered first two questions with a no
his incompleteness theorem used self-referential statements
Turing's teacher Max Newman teaches Turing about Hilbert's questions
Turing comes up with Logical Computing Machine as thought experiment
Logical Computing Machine: infinite length of paper tape containing symbols within squares; machine reads symbols and performs actions based on instructions table
Turing went on to show that noncomputable numbers existed, related to the halting problem
halting problem: there can be no method to determine in advance whether any given instruction table combined with inputs will run indefinitely
thus: no mechanical procedure can detrmine the provability of every mathematical statement
Turing's paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" published in 1937
Max Newman sends Turing off to Princeton to study under Alonzo Church
Turing's paper doesn't get much attention
Turing asks mother to send out reprints to Bertrand Russell and some other scholars
only major review is done by Alonzo Church who introduces the term Turing Machine
Claude Shannon applies Boole logic for electrical circuits
relay: a switch that can be opened/shut electrically using an electromagnet
ones that clack open/closed sometimes called electromechanical because they have moving parts
vacuum tubes and transistors can be used as switches in electrical circuits; they're called electronic since they manipulate flow of electrons but do not require movement of physical parts
logic gate: switch that can handle one or more inputs
George Stibitz was working at Bell Labs around same time; uses relays and bulbs to show you could create a calculating machine with them
Bell Labs needed to amplify a phone signal over long distance while filtering out static
solution involved complex numbers
Stibitz gets chance to build machine to help => The Complex Number Calculator completed in 1939
Howard Aiken lobbies Harvard to build a more sophisticated computer to help with calculations
Harvard Mark I built under Howard Aiken after project control transferred to Navy
Mark I was slower but fully automatic
in 1937 Konrad Zuse in Germany builds binary calculator that can read instructions from punched tape
through various prototypes, with Z3 being the first fully working all-purpose programmable digital computer

John Mauchly meets Atanasoff and later builds ENIAC with Eckert (legal dispute ensues)
Turing works at Bletchley Park
Grace Hopper, Jean Jennings, and other women program the ENIAC
John von Neumann improves on ENIAC and essentially gets all credit for it
Mauchly and Eckert leave to form Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation -> Rand -> Unisys; they built UNIVAC which is purchased by Census Bureau
von Neumann returns to Princeton and works on a stored program computer
Neumann leaves to join Atomic Energy Commission and group dissolves; this leads to shift of innovation to corporate realm beginning in 1950s
William Shockley leads team at Bell Labs
Bell Labs sets out to develop vacuum tube replacement using semiconductors

Jack Kilby joins Texas Instruments; builds the first microchip
Jean Hoerni, a Fairchild physicist places a layer of silicon oxide to protect the transistor
Noyce and Moore start looking into making multiple devices on single piece of silicon
patent battle ensues between Texas Instruments and Fairchild
even if texas instruments were to be awarded a patent for putting multiple components on a single chip, Fairchild hoped to be awarded a patent for making the connections through printed metal lines instead of wires
in April 1961 Noyce was declared the inventor of the microchip
some legal confusion later and Kilby granted patent
Fairchild appeals and wins
Fairchild and Texas Instruments come to a truce and agree to co-license to each other
Kilby and Noyce seen as coinventors
first major market for microchips is military
in 1962 Strategic Air Command designed land-based missile Minuteman II that required two thousands microchips just on onboard guidance system
Navy also buying chips for submarine-launched missile Polaris
first consumer devices to use microchips are hearing aids
Texas Instruments starts working on pocket calculators
fairchild camera and instrument buy fairchild semiconductor and stifle creativity
many leave; Jean Hoerni and 3 others leave to start Teledyne funded by Arthur Rock

DARPA has repeatedly lost the D: created in 1958 as ARPA, renamed DARPA in 1972, ARPA in 1993, back to DARPA in 1996
Licklider comes up with idea for "Libraries of the Future"
Licklider recruited to DC to head information processing at DARPA
Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts worked at ARPA (not on friendly terms)
work on ARPA networking project begins, which is eventually named ARPA Net -> ARPANET by Larry Roberts at a conference: Oct 1967
Roger Scantlebury comes up with idea to break messages into small units called packets
the packet idea had been developed independently by Paul Baran at RAND
different methods for sending data through a network:
  circuit switching: similar to a phone system, a set of switches creates a dedicated circuit for signals to go back and forth during conversation and connection remains open
  message switching (aka store-and-forward switching): entire message given address header, sent into network, then passed along from node to node
  packet switching: messages broken into packets, given address headers, then sent to their destinations
Leonard Kleinrock claims credit for packet stuff, other internet founders kinda flip out at such a claim
Larry Roberts sent out soliciation for bids to companies that might want to build the minicomputers that would be sent to each research center to build the minicomputers
contract goes to BBN, team led by Frank Heart and Robert Kahn
Roberts selects four research centers to be the first ARPANET nodes: UCLA, Stanford Research Lab, University of Utah, and UCSB
UCLA grad student Stephen Crocker leads group of grad students on figuring out how their host computers will connect to the standardized ARPANET IMPs
Crocker comes up with idea for 'Request for Comments' or RFC
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) wanted local-area network to connect office work stations
recent Harvard PhD Bob Metcalfe created way to use coaxial cable to create high-bandwidth system that he named "Ethernet"
it was modeled on wireless network developed in Hawaii called ALOHAnet which sent packet data through UHF and satellite signals
there was a packet radio network in San Francisco called PRNET with a satellite version called SATNET
these systems were not compatible so in 1973 Robert Kahn set out to fix that
Kahn worked with Vint Cerf to work on system that was referred to as an "internetwork" later shortened to "internet"
traffic between ARPANET and any other network had to be seamless; they came up with an Internet Protocol (IP) that specified how to put the packet's destination in its header and helped determine how it would travel through networks to get there
layered above the IP was Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that instructed how to put the packets back together in the right order, checked to see if any of them were missing and requested retransmission of any info that had been lost
in July 1945 Vannevar Bush wrote essay for Atlantic titled "As We May Thing" foreseeing a personal machine he dubbed a memex

these ideas would later be advanced by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC
Engelbart demos The Mother of All Demos on Dec 9, 1968
Alan Kay joins Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) run by John McCarthy; isn't a good fit
Kay joins Xerox PARC and eventually works on creating the laptop (initially called Dynabook); he creates Smalltalk for the OS software

The Faith Healers
====
3 types of faith:
  intransigent: faith will not be affected by any sort of contrary evidence, no matter how strong
  the will to believe: willful belief where there is insufficient or no evidence either way to make a rational choice
  hypothesis based upon evidence: evidence but not enough evidence or evidence of good enough quality to support total belief
Paracelsus sought medicine in magic
Lourdes healing fountain
laying on of hands originated with nineteenth-century American/European evangelists
Reverend William Branham of Indiana brought modern evangelist/fundamentalist healing movement into existence in the 1940s
doctors and nurses in US have revitalized the International Order of St. Luke the Physician, and Episcopal group stressing a spiritual approach to the practice of medicine
order grew as result of evangelist Oral Roberts's success in the 1950s
evangelist Rex Humbard who began broadcasting in 1952 in Ohio is largely responsible for television format used by faith-healers
Johannes Weyer, sixteenth century physician, also known as Piscinarius, was early skeptic of belief
seed-faith system

The Hot Zone
====
Charles Monet, Frenchman who lived on private lands of Nzoia Sugar Factory, a plantation in western Kenya, patient zero of virus
Marburg virus is an African organism named for place first discovered (Behring Works factory in Marburg that produced vaccines using kidney cells from African green monkeys)
first person known to be infected by Marburg virus was employee named Klaus F.
Marburg kills 1 in 4
Yellow fever kills 1 in 20
Marburg is one of family of viruses known as filoviruses (thread virus)
most viruses are ball-shaped particles resembing peppercorns
Marburg is the only ring-shaped virus known (resemble Cheerios or a tub of spaghetti when spilled out)
effects of Marburg on brain resemble that of rabies
filoviruses comprises Marburg and two types of Ebola: Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan
Ebola Zaire kill rate is 9 in 10
Marburg has special affinity for eyes and testicles (can linger there for months even after death)
Kasensero one of the first places AIDS appeared
strain that killed Charles Monet is known today as the Musoke strain after the doctor who contracted it from Monet
Ebola virus named for Ebola River
Ebola distantly related to measles, mumps, and rabies
triggers rash all over body
Ebola virus particle contains only seven different proteins
ultraviolet door between Level 1 and Level 2
ultraviolet light smashes virus' genetic material and makes them unable to replicate
negative air pressure designed to keep hot agents from drifting outward
first line of defense against a hot agent is sticky tape because it seals cracks
July 6 1976: Mr. Yu G. first identified case in outbreak of unknown virus (later known as Ebola Sudan)
Ebola Sudan lethality comparable to Black Plague
to this day first human case of Ebola Zaire has never been identified
overlap between victims is in Kitum Cave
Racal suit is a portable, positive-pressure space suit with battery-powered air supply
T-61: euthanasia agent
set out patches of paper saturated with spores of harmless bacterium known as Bacillus subtilis niger
a decon job that kills niger will kill almost anything
sunbeam electric frying pans are Army's tool of choice for decon job
electric frying pans cooked disinfecting crystals
crystals released formaldehyde gas as they boiled
leave gas in sealed off building for 3 days then check that the treatment killed the niger
Reston virus (monkey house) turns out to not kill humans even though it does infect them
likely that Reston outbreak started with single monkey in Philippines
kwisha = finished
Swahili word askari used to mean spear bearer; now it means an armed guard who carries an assault rifle and walks in your shadow

Brain Maker: The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brain–for Life
====
in nineteenth century Russian-born biologist Elie Mechnikov made link between longevity and healthy balance of bacteria in body
two most common groups of organisms in the gut, forming 90% of bacteria in colon, are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
firmicutes are fat-loving bacteria, equipped with more enzymes to digest complex carbs (more efficient at extracting energy); they increase fat absorption
obese people have elevated levels of firmicutes
two most studied strains of bacteria are Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus
Escherichia coli produces vitamin K but can cause severe illness
Heliobacter pylori causes peptic ulcers but regulates appetite
we're born with Clostridium dificile but it can grow unchecked based on diet
cytokines are small proteins released by cells that affect the behavior of other cells and are often important participants in inflammatory process
C-reactive protein, interleukin six (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor apha (TNF-a) are all cytokines
TNF-a elevated in inflammatory conditions such as Alzheimer's, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, and asthma
elevated blood sugar causes inflammation in the bloodstream and triggers reaction called glycation
glycation: biological process by which sugar binds to proteins and certain fats, resulting in deformed molecules
these sugar proteins are called advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
good gut bacteria are capable of producing important brain chemicals like BDNF, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate
BDNF is involved in neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are created
BDNF also protects existing neurons
Cyrex Array 2: gut permeability test that measures antibodies produced by immune system when confronted by molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
byproduct of mitochondria is production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aka free radicals
free radicals, known for negative effects of aging, also take part in apoptosis (process by which cells undergo self-destruction)
our fingers formed through apoptosis
apoptosis also allows our bodies to rid themselves of cancer cells
cells lacking a nucleus can still commit apoptosis; mitochondria determine whether a cell shall live or die
all of the mitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the female lineage
lower levels of BDNF have been associated with human anxiety and depression
serotonin synthesized from tryptophan
when tryptophan is degraded in body by certain enzymes, it becomes unavailable for production of serotonin
one of byproducts of degraded tryptophan is kynurenine so high levels of kynurenine are good indicator of low tryptophan levels
Bifidobacterium infantis associated with lower levels of kynurenine
people with autism tend to have higher levels of clostridial specials; people with autism tend to crave carbs, especially refined sugars
three main fatty acids produced by gut microbes are acetic, propionic, and butyric acid
clostridial species produce propionic acid (PPA) in abundance
PPA increases gut permeability
individuals with autism are typically deficient in glutathione

to gibbet is to dip a corpse in tar and suspend it in a flat iron cage (gibbet) in plain view of townsfolk while it rots and gets pecked apart by crows
competition with Paris schools where unclaimed corpses of poor who died at city hospitals could be used for dissection
by 1828 demands of London's anatomy schools were such that 10 full-time, 200 part-time people dedicated to body snatching throughout dissecting season (anatomy courses were held only between October and May to avoid rapid decomposition in warmer weather)
Burke and Hare kill people to sell their corpses
Burke hanged, Hare granted immunity
burke becomes synonym for smother
in ancient China, Confucian doctrine considered dissection a defilement of the human body and forbade its practice
this was a problem for Huang Ti, Father of Chinese Medicine, who around 2600 BC set out to write authoritative medical and anatomical text
even without dissection Huang Ti was able to figure out that blood of body is under control of the heart and the blood current flows in a continuous circle and never stops
Galen of Imperial Rome also never did a human dissection, but figured some things out through a bunch of animal dissections
Hippocrates also never dissected a human
Renassaince anatomist Belgian Andreas Vesalius got hands dirty in dissection
his book De Humani Corporis Fabrica is the most venerated anatomy book in history
1960s saw first heart transplant and passing of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, both of which raised awareness of need for organs for transplantation and of body donation as an option
around same time there was a notable increase in cost of funerals
The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford criticized funeral industry leading to upswing in cremation
potassium level of gel inside eyes is helpful during first 24 hours
algor mortis, cooling of dead body, also hepful
corposes lose about 1.5 deg F per hour until they reach the temperature of air around them
rigor mortis is more variable; starts a few hours after death, usually in head and neck, and continues down body disappearing anywhere from ten to forty-eight hours after death
if body has been dead longer than three days, investigators turn to entomological clues (age of fly larvae)
stages of decay
  fresh: involves autolysis (self-digestion)
  bloat: intestinal gas is waste product of bacteria metabolism. once dead, bodies don't expel gas and builds up causing bloat. small intestine is collapsed
         and sealed off. intestines eventually give way
  putrefaction/decay: digestive organs and lungs disintegrate first. brain liquefies next. up until about 3 weeks organs can be identified
skin slip, or gloving, is where skin will come off
by analyzing liquids of human decay in soil you can tell if a body has been moved. if the unique volatile fatty acids and compounds of human decay aren't there, the body didn't decompose there
aroma scan technology being developed for estimating time of death (electronic nose)
human remains dogs can pinpoint the location of a corpse at the bottom of a lake by sniffing water's surface for gases
eye caps invented by morticians to help dead people keep their eyes shut
first people known to attempt arterial embalming were trio of Dutch biologists and anatomists named Swammerdam, Ruysch, and Blanchard in late 1600s
intention was to preserve bodies to work around chronic shortage of bodies for dissection
arterial embalming didn't catch on until American Civil War
Thomas Holmes, father of embalming, sold his patented embalming fluid Innominata
cut carotid artery, insert cannula into artery connected by tubing to cannister of embalming fluid
embalming fluid contains red coloring to make skin look pink
water reverses chemical reactions of embalming
dead person = decedent
maximum amount a rib cage can compress without damaging internal organs is 2.75 inches
first Fords came without windshields, which is why drivers wore goggles
car windshields then had window glass and then tempered glass
cadavers used to determine force of impact of head against tempered glass
GM's first collapsible steering wheel shaft, introduced in the 1960s, cut the risk of death in a head-on collision by half
flail chest is a condition in which all your ribs break and your rib cage can't help inflate your lungs
electric cauterizing wand looks like cheap bank pen on cord, functions like a scalpel, cutting and burning (any vessels that are severed are melted shut)
ancient Egyptians believed the ka, the esssence of a person, resided in the heart; the heart was the only organ left inside a mummified corpse
Babylonians believed it resided in the liver
mellified man: dead human remains steeped in honey
macerate: soften in liquid
Jews would sell fake mummies in Alexandria
medical use of feces around since Pliny
dropsy aka edema
human blood used to treat leprosy
scrofula aka King's evil aka Mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis: disease with glandular swellings
for six to eight hours, the blood in a dead body remains sterile and red blood cells retain oxygen-carrying capabilities
Soviets were big on using blood from cadavers
only person outside of USSR to try it was Dr. Kevorkian
some people cook and eat placenta to stave off postpartum depression
