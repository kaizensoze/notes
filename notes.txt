08/25/16: Just a reminder. Like clockwork, immediately, my brain just freezes up with horrible "brain fog". I pretty much feel high and/or retarded. For two days or so I felt perfectly fine. Digestive system/appetite normal. All of a sudden hungry as hell, brain fog, inability to concentrate. This is awful.

to figure out scale:
    just remember the step intervals
    tonic supertonic mediant subdominant dominant submediant leading/subtonic

to figure out key conversions:
    a flat is -1, a sharp is +1
    C -> C#: +7
    C -> Cb: -7
    C(major) -> c(minor): -3

to remember order of sharps:
    Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle

to remember order of flats:
    Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father

to figure out chords:
    just remember note intervals

interview assignment
====
two parts

1) build
grab json from a url you have control over
load it into a collection view
specify layout specs that would require overriding collection view layout methods (minimumInter...)
tapping into collection view shows very basic detail view

2) debug
change some of the code they submit
change some of the json returned by the url

key things to mention on giving the assignment:
  "Treat this as the beginning of a large project as opposed to a one-off assignment."

linux
====
3 main layers
  user-space
    applications

  kernel-space
    system call interface
    kernel subsystems
    device drivers

  hardware

each processor doing 1 of 3 things at any given moment:
  * in user-space, executing user code in a process
  * in kernel-space, in process context, executing on behalf of a specific process
  * in kernel-space, in interrupt context, not associated with process, handling an interrupt

major.minor.revision.stable (ex: 2.6.26.1)
minor odd -> development
minor even -> stable

kernel does not have access to libc or standard headers
kernel has its own equivalent of functions (ex: printk instead of printf)

use of inline functions for performance optimization (use sparingly; ex: static inline void wolf(unsigned long tail_size) )
use of inline assembly
branch annotation (ex: unlikely(error), likely(success) )
float point discouraged in kernel
small, fixed-size stack

task list: circular doubly linked list
each element is a process descriptor of type struct task_struct {
  unsigned long state
  int prio
  struct task_struct *parent
  struct list_head tasks
  pid
  ...
}
task_struct allocated via slab allocator
at the end of kernel stack of each process is the struct thread_info {
  struct task_struct *task
  struct exec_domain *exec_domain
  __u32 flags
  __u32 status
  __u32 cpu
  int preempt_count
  ...
}
current macro for process descriptor of currently executing task = current_thread_info()->task
process descriptor states
  TASK_RUNNING: process currently running or on runqueue (only state possible for process executing in user-space)
  TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping
  TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping but doesn't wake up when signalled
  __TASK_TRACED: process is being traced
  __TASK_STOPPED: process has stopped; not running and not eligible to run
change task state with set_task_state(task, state)
all processes descendants of init process, whose PID is one
for_each_process() iterates over entire task list

linked list funkiness
list_for_each()
list_for_each_entry()
list_entry()

scheduler classes
  SCHED_NORMAL
    handled by CFS
    CFS uses the scheduler entity struct, struct sched_entity {
      ...
      on_rq
      ...
      vruntime
      ...
    }
    vruntime: amount of time spent running normalized by the number of runnable processes

process priority
  real-time (0 to 99)
  nice (-20 to 19)

CRISPR (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY&feature=youtu.be)
====
bacteriophages (phages), which are a virus, hunt and kill bacteria by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over
the bacteria try to resist but fail most of the time
sometimes bacteria survive the phages and save a part of the virus dna in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR
when the virus attacks again, the bacteria quickly makes an RNA copy from CRISPR and arms protein CAS9
if the bacteria finds a match against the dna of the attacking virus, the DNA from CAS9 is activated and cuts out the virus DNA, protecting it from virus attack
scientists figured out the CRISPR system is programmable

Harris: Triggerfish -> StingRay -> Hailstorm

caduceus vs rod of asclepius
====
The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, eloquence, trickery, and negotiation.
Tangential association of the caduceus with medicine has occurred through the ages, where it was sometimes associated with alchemy and wisdom.
The modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.

limitless worker surveillance
====
in Feb 1855 Allan Pinkerton met with attorney Edward Rucker at Chicago Masonic Hall to discuss need for greater control over employees
they decided to form Pinkerton National Detective Agency
The Pinkertons served role of infiltrating/busting unions and monitoring workers
Congress later passes Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 which limited federal government's ability to hire Pinkertons (private employers still could)

"I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter tied to this fucking couch." - The Thing

"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how."

“That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.”
