in a sense Brigadier General Carter Clarke was the founding father ot the NSA
Clarke's Special Branch was a part of the Army G-2 in the Pentagon created after Pearl Harbor, the unit to which all intercepts were sent for analysis
the army's SIGINT organization, the Signal Security Agency (SSA), was a separate field agency that was (until 1944) part of the Army Signal Corps
when Clarke took command of the Special Branch of Army G-2 in May 1942, they were able to read the top Japanese comms helping win the battle of Midway
they worked with Britain's Bletchley Park
the US was reading the codes of more than 40 countries, including allies and the Axis
before the end of the war Clarke knew the Soviet Union would be the next main enemy and ordered to begin cracking Russian codes in Jan 1943
the Navy had its own code-breaking operations headquartered in Washington
Russians were doing a better job than everyone else
in Oct 1943, Richard Hallock made first break into Russian ciphers (Russians were reusing their one time pads)
Russian intelligence changes:
    1922-1923: after postrevolutionary Cheka, it became the State Political Directorate (GPU)
    1923-1934: United State Political Directorate (OGPU)
    1934-1943: Main Directorate for State Security (GUGB)
    1943-1946: People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB)
    1946-1953: Ministry for State Security (MGB)
    1953-1954: Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD)
    1954-1991: Committee for State Security (KGB)
    Oct 1991: KGB dissolved following collapse of the USSR and the abortive coup against Mikhail Gorbachev
on Sept 1945, the SSA was redesignated as the Army Security Agency (ASA)
super-secret intercept program known as Operation Gold: in May 1946, two years before the creation of the state of Israel, the US Navy COMINT org began intercepting the international telephone calls and cable traffic of Jewish agents in the US who were engaged in raising money and buying arms for the Jewish underground in Palestine
On March 5, 1946, Winston Churchill delivers famous speech in Fulton, Missouri warning about the Iron Curtain
informal war time arrangements between American and British COMINT formalized on same day
as Churchill has delivering his speech, a group of Senior American and British intelligence officials were signing a Top Secret intelligence-sharing agreement called the British-United States Communication Intelligence Agreement (BRUSA Agreement)
there was to be a free and complete exchange of information between Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the US orgs
other SIGINT allies-Canada, Australia, New Zealand-referenced in agreement
in 1954 BRUSA morphs into United Kingdom-United States (UKUSA) Agreement
on Sept 5, 1945, Russian cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko walked out of Russian embassy in Ottawa and defected to Canada
info from Gouzenko helped the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identify seventeen spies working for the Soviet military intelligence service (GRU) in Canada and Britain
Richard Pritchard headed GCHQ
during the 1948 Berlin Crisis, it was COMINT that showed the Soviets had no intention of launching an attack on West Berlin or West Germany
on June 26, 1948, the Soviets cut off all access to West Berlin, forcing the US and Britain to begin massive airlift to keep West Berlin supplied with foodstuffs and coal for heating
on Friday, October 29, 1948, just as Truman was preparing to give a speech at Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City, the Russian government and military executed a massive change of virtually all of their cipher systems. This day was later known as Black Friday
US/UK cryptanalysts would be unable to decrypt more complicated ciphers until tenure of Admiral Bobby Ray Inman in the late 1970s
Russian military and key Soviet government ministries began encrypting their telephone calls using a newly developed voice scrambling device called Vhe Che (High Frequency)
Russians made massive shift because William Weisband, forty-year-old Russian linguist with ASA, told the KGB everything he knew
on Oct 20 1948, newly independent US Air Force formally activated its own COMINT, the US Air Force Security Service (USAFSS)
CIA had been created in 1947
between December 1948 and June 1950, Meredith Gardner decrypted portions of Soviet Venona ciphers that helped the FBI identify Judith Coplon, Julius Rosenberg, Klaus Fuchs, Donald MacLean, David Green-glass, Julius Rosenberg, and Theodore Alvin Hall; only 15 of the 206 Soviet agents identified in the Venona decrypts were prosecuted
forty individuals identified as having spied for Russia fled before they could be prosecuted, including MacLean, Guy Burgess, and Kim Philby
by 1950 COMINT was looking pretty weak
there was no COMINT on North Korea before the Korean War broke out (they just weren't a priority over the USSR)
on June 28, 1950, Seoul fell to the North Korean invasion [without a fight] three days after it began
North Korea was incompetent with COMINT and all of their military tactical codes and ciphers were broken
with COMINT compromised, North Korea essentially got owned
AFSA was able to read the cable traffic of best informed foreign diplomat based in Beijing, Dr. Kavalam Madhava Panikkar, India's ambassador to China
intercepts of Panikkar's cables to New Delhi in July/August 1940 revealed he had been told by Chou Enlai that the Chinese would not intervene militarily in Korea
decrypted cables of the Burmese ambassador in Beijing warned that China now intended to become militarily involved in Korea
on Sept 25, Chou Enlai warned Indian ambassador that China would intervene if UN forces crossed the 38th parallel
Panikkar's reporting was discounted/ignored, but China wasn't bluffing
on Oct 1 South Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel; the next day, Mao Tsetung ordered 260,000 Chinese troops to begin crossing the Yalu River on October 15
on Oct 15-16, China enters the Korean War
it was discovered the Russians were actually controlling the air defense of North Korea and Manchuria
on June 13, 1952, President Truman welcomed CIA director Walter Smith and executive secretary of the NSC James Lay to Oval Office; Smith gave Truman a copy of a Top Secret Codeword report on the state of health of the US national SIGINT effort, the much-anticipated Brownell Report of AFSA
the Brownell Committee called for a complete overhaul and reorganization of AFSA => The NSA is born
Eisenhower sworn in on Jan 20, 1953
Stalin dies on Mar 4, 1953
Eisenhower annoyed news came from AP and Moscow as opposed to SIGINT
1956, year of crisis:
    violent worker riots take place in Polish city of Poznan and crushed by Polish troops
    riots break out in Budapest
NSA SIGINT picked up that there were Russians prepped to go around virtually every major Hungarian city
Israel attacks Egyptian forces in Gaza strip
25, 000 Hungarians killed in uprising
USAFSS Russian linguist listing to transmission of a MiG trying to shoot down a U-2 plane discovered the engine crapped out at a certain altitude
on May 1, 1960, a surface-to-air missile (SAM) shoots down a U-2 plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers
on Jan 20, 1961, JFK sworn in as 35th president
at the time NSA had a budget of $654M, while CIA had a budget of $401.6M
Jack Frost was a disaster as head of NSA (not on good terms with Kennedy administration among other things)
by 1962 McNamara fired Frost
by July 1962, SIGINT showed that the Cuban MiG fighters were now routinely conducting ground-controlled intercept (CGI) air defense exercises and on two occasions intercepted intruding aircraft, clear evidence that the Cuban air force was fast becoming combat ready
NSA was able to tap into the Cuban national telephone system; this was possible because the American telecommunications giant RCA International had built the system in 1957 and it used vulnerable micro wave relay system rather than invulnerable landlines to carry virtually all telephone traffice between Havana and all major towns and cities in Cuba
in 1960, the Soviets began to replace the American-made equipment with Russian communications and crypographic equipment; NSA estimated it would take them about two years to replace it but with the lack of spare parts blah blah blah, they'd just stick with the American system
a "burst" transmission is one in which the message is compressed electronically and the information packed into the "burst" takes only seconds to be transmitted and received
SIGINT detected four Soviet Foxtrot-class attack submarines departing Northern Fleet naval bases on the Kola Peninsula
U-2 imagery showed the Russians had accelerated their work on completing the ballistic missile sites in Cuba
Cuban saboteurs blew up four electrical substations in western Venezuela

Predator invented by Israeli Avraham Karem
GPS, designed primarily by inventor Roger L. Easton, consists of 31 satellites, each passing overhead at an altitude of 12,600 miles twice a day
satellites' orbits ensure that, at any one time, at least 4 satellites are in line of sight from any point on the planet
Special Operations Executive (SOE), clandestine British warfare agency set up by Winston Churchill in 1940
not everyone was on board to kill Hitler. Colonel Ronald Thornley said he would be canonized and it would look bad resorting to such low methods
SOE was fairly ineffective
early CIA: "swashbuckling of the worst kind"
according to Castro's longtime bodyguard, Fabien Escalante, there were no less than 638 attempts on Castro's life, most of them by the CIA
according to Bissell, the order to set up an assassination squad known as Special Group (Augmented) came directly from National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy and his deputy Walt Rostow
President Ford banned assassinations with Executive Order 11905 in 1976 stating that "No employee of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination"
Mir Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani who gunned down CIA employees on their way into work at Langley in 1993
CIA knew about future 9/11 hijackers al-Midhar and al-Hazmi and that they had a multiple-entry visa for the US, but didn't pass info to FBI
they then knew that they were in the US but didn't tell FBI due to petty dislike of chief of FBI National Security Division in New York, John O'Neill
al-Midhar and al-Hazmi rented a fucking room from an FBI informant
JSTARS = Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, originally developed to track Soviet armored divisions racing across the plains of northern Europe by collecting radar images of moving objects and processing them with on-board computers in order to target the advanced formations (never worked properly)
Operation Anaconda doesn't go very well
new model of satellite phone for civilians in middle east, the Thuraya, had a GPS system that was not very accurate (within a 100m distance)
for a targeted kill, civilians could be killed but not that many without clearance from higher authority. The number was <30
when clearance was requested to kill more civilians, no case was refused
in the 1990s the DEA forged a profitable relationship with the NSA
JSOC under McChrystal's command similarly turned to the powerful NSA
IMSI Catcher technology was developed by the NSA
SCIF member who saw secret JSOC raid logs before they were shredded: "They were really running riot, shooting up rooms-full of people, massacring families, night after night after night."
$200,000 Seeker, built by Jordanian company, looked like a helicopter and was small and cheap, but squashed. (too cheap and effective, might reduce budget?)
IEDs detonated by radio waves become a big problem
Warlock radio jammers are introduced as countermeasure, which quickly become irrelevant as insurgents switch to low-tech methods like a buried command wire
stigmergic systems use simple environmental signals to coordinate actions of independent agents
goal was to make it more risky for insurgents to place IEDs
one attempt was to have the Iraqi cell-phone companies put a random delay of a few seconds for a call to go through
bullshit Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) formed 
some tried methods: training of bees to detect homemade bombs, sniffer dogs, a molecular sniffer called "Fido"
most of these programs were useless but expensive
air force research lab in Dayton, OH hard developed the Gotcha radar system: drone-mounted, remaining aloft for 24 hours or more
Gotcha was actually a variant on JSTARS
The MQ9 Reaper drone, General Atomics' successor to the Predator, was introduced in 2005
the Reaper costs 30M, and 5M/year to maintain; capable of patrolling for up to 30 hours; lasts half that when carrying armaments, and crashes at least twice as often as the manned F-15, F-16 fighters
a slant: confusing women and children with military aged males
Northrop's Global Hawk aircraft is junk; can't see clouds, radar is crap, falls apart
by 2012 even the air force had had enough saying the U2 spy plane could do a better job
Northrop Grumman's vice president for government relations Sid Ashworth fights back and saves the useless aircraft
on February 24, 2014 Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announces a series of stringent cuts to the US military, including the entire force of A-10s, and the U-2 was replaced by the Global Hawk
Sierra Nevada Corporation touts revolutionary airborne surveillance system called Gorgon Stare, which will transmit live video images of physical movement across an entire town; the thing didn't actually work
from earlier in book, al-Qaeda was pretty much retired, happy with the US now overseeing Afghanistan, etc., but then the local warlords get chummy with the US military and start selling out competitors/rivals, having them tortured, so all the locals get pissed off and come out of the woodworks to fight again
Seal Team 6 becomes Navy Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU)
at some point two separate arms of the agency were vying for control of the Predator: the Counterterrorism Center (CTC), and the Special Activities Division; the CTC won out
once the CTC owned the Predator, they had to get waivers from target countries to use it
in 2004 the CIA got permission to use it in Pakistan in exchange for the head of a militant tribal strongman in Waziristan named Nek Muhammad Wazir
Cofer Black and Jose Rodriguez kinda go nutso with the torture stuff
Rodriguez replaced by Robert Grenier who was fired for opposing the torture/rendition shit (he really wasn't against it, just didn't think it was being done right)
Grenier replaced by "Mike" (Michael D'Andrea)
Alec Station, the unit set up in 1996 to hunt Osama bin Laden, was abolished in 2006, but was actually just renamed
growing scale of the Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistani Taliban known as TTP)
two rival tribes in Pakistan: the Mehsuds and the Wazirs
Mehsud were dubbed the wolves due to their ferociousness
the Wazirs were at peace with the Pakistani government and more interested in fighting the US in Afghanistan
the CIA were more interested in the Wazirs until the NSA picked up a phone call that Baitullah Mehsud of the Mehsud had a nuclear weapon; it was concluded he had a dirty bomb
Baitullah Mehsud had attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team and a police academy in Lahore
Baitullah killed and replaced by his more capable cousin Hakimullah
Baitullah was nurturing a Jordanian jihadi doctor and blogger named Humam Balawi, who convinced Jordanian intelligence he was a double agent
Balawi was invited to CIA base Khost, blew up seven CIA
Hakimullah later killed, but it helped increase Mehsud's rivals, the Haqqanis
Hakimullah's replacement was Maulana Fazlullah known as Mullah Radio for pronouncing beheadings for infractions of sharia law such as polio vaccinations
the CIA and JSOC move on to Yemen
Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's corrupt dictator since 1978 has fun feeding the CIA and JSOC bad info
Jaber al-Shabwani, deputy governor of Marib province, mistakenly killed by drone strike based on bad info
Jaber al-Shabwani was a cousn of Ayer al-Shabwani, a prominent local al-Qaeda leader
Shabwani's father, Sheikh Ali al-Shabwani, in retaliation, leads his tribe in blowing up section of trans-Yemen oil pipeline
Washington suspends drone operations in Yemen for a year
Anwar al-Awlaki added to CIA's kill list in April 2011, meanwhile everyone knew where he was and no one arrested him
Justice Department lawyers cook up justification for killing Awlaki
the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in Dec 2006 that targeted preventions would be legal in certain cases when absolutely necessary, but, according to IDF whistle-blower Anat Kamm, the Israeli military routinely disregarded the judgement anyway; Kamm sentenced to 4.5 years in prison
Awlaki killed in Sep 2011 and his son killed two weeks later at a restaurant where a high-value target Ibrahim al-Banna was thought to be eating
Awlaki was a target due to connection to two failed attempts to explode bombs on American planes, and his mentoring of Nidal Malik Hasan, the army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas in Nov 2009
Saleh hands the land to al-Qaeda and then starts bombing them along with the US
Saleh replaced by Abd Rubbah Mansour Hadi
in general, it would've been a lot safer to just go in and arrest people rather than kill them [and nearby civilians] with drones
ISR = Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, acquisition and processing of military intelligence
in first decade of 21st century, new acronym entered military jargon: A2/AD, antiaccess/area denial (strong defenses against US incursions)
RQ-170 stealth drone nicknamed "the Beast of Kandahar"
General Atomics got 2 billion from the Pentagon in 2013 (0.68% of US defense contracts that year), small compared to 37 billion brought in by leading contractor Lockheed Martin
prime contractors, the five giant firms that emerged from mergers of early 1990s, not interested in General Atomics' drones since they didn't net that much per unit
RQ-180, like the Beast, operated jointly by the air force and CIA
the RQ-180 was just surveillance; a drone designed to do a bunch of things was desired so the US Navy put out a 3.7 billion contract
in 2009 Shia insurgents in Iraq used SkyGrabber software (29.95) to capture and download Predator video feeds
in Dec 2011 an RQ-170 landed in Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard put it on display

Walter Cannon focused on adaptive aspect of stress-response in dealing with emergencies
Hans Selye formalized the ill effects of stress with ulcerated rat experiment
autonomic nervous system includes sympathetic and parasympathetic systems
sympathetic: fight, flight, fright, sex
parasympathetic: chill
"safety features" exist so that parts of the brain that trigger sympathetic inhibit the parasympathetic and vice versa
neural route represented by sympathetic system is first means to mobilize response to stressor
another way is through secretion of hormones
if a neuron secretes a chemical messenger that travels and causes next cell in line to do something different, that messenger is a neurotransmitter
if a neuron secretes a messenger that instead percolates into the bloodstream, that messenger is a hormone
used to be believed that testicles secrete less testosterone with age
wealthy people would get injected with testicular extracts from other animals [and could even pick the animal]
this led to organotherapy: grafting of little bits of testes
in 1944 Geoffrey Harris proposes that brain is also a hormonal gland
Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally start looking for these brain hormones
14 years later, the chemical structure of the first releasing hormone is published
they get the Nobel Price in 1976
the hypothalamus contains a huge array of releasing and inhibiting hormones
two hormones vital to stress-response are epinephrine and norepinephrine released by sympathetic nervous system
another important class of hormones in response to stress are glucocorticoids
glucocorticoids are steroid hormones
steroid is used to describe general chemical structure of five classes of hormones: androgens (anabolic), estrogens, progestins, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids
secreted by the adrenal gland, often act similar to epinephrine
epinephrine acts within seconds, glucocorticoids back this up over course of minutes or hours
a putative hormone is referred to as a factor until its chemical structure is confirmed (ex: CRF -> CRH)
CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) triggers pituitary to release hormone ACTH (corticotropin)
ACTH is released into bloodstream, reaches adrenal gland, and triggers glucocorticoid release
in times of stress pancreas is stimulated to release hormone glucagon
glucocorticoids, glucagon, and the sympathetic nervous system raise circulating levels of sugar glucose
pituitary also secretes prolactin, which suppresses reproduction during stress
pituitary and brain secrete class of endogenous morphine-like substances called endorphins and enkephalins which help blunt pain perception
pituitary also secretes vasopressin, aka antidiuretic hormone, which plays role in cardiovascular stress-response
sympathetic arousal is a relative marker of anxiety and vigilance
heavy secretion of glucocorticoids is more a marker of depression

ada byron (=> lovelace) daughter of poet lord byron
ada lovelace meets charles babbage
charles babbage builds a Difference Engine, which can solve polynomial equations
at Cambridge, Babbage along with John Herschel and George Peacock form a club called Analytical Society
Analytical Society campaigned to get university to abandon Newton's dot notation calculus and replace with Leibniz' dx/dy notation
in 1640s, Blaise Pascal created mechanical calculator for tax purposes
Leibniz tries to improve it with multiplication/division (does not completely succeed due to not being an engineer)
Babbage and hired engineer not quite skilled enough to get Difference Engine working
Babbage dreams up something else: The Analytical Machine
Analytical Machine is the product of what Ada Lovelace, in her essay on imagination, called "the Combining Faculty"
Babbage applies the automated loom, invited in 1801 by Joseph-Marie Jacquard
Babbage unable to get funding from British government
Babbage meets future prime minister of Italy Menabrea who publishes description of Analytical Machine in French
ada adds translation and "Notes by the Translator"; the notes become more famous than the article itself
notes make ada destined to become iconic figure in history of computing
in ada's notes she explores 4 concepts
1) a general-purpose machine, one that could perform a preset task but could be programmed and reprogrammed to do limitless and changeable array of tasks
2) the machine could store, manipulate, process, and act upon anything that could be expressed in symbols
3) figure out in step-by-step detail the workings of a program/algorithm (used Bernoulli numbers as example)
4) machines cannot think (later dubbed "Lady Lovelace's Objection" by Alan Turing)
babbage wanted ada to push the govt for funding
ada refuses, babbage then writes an attack against govt and cowardly asks ada to include it in her notes
babbage sends appendage anyway and they reply telling him to man up and submit it separately with his name
babbage asks ada not to send her notes; she refuses and he backs down and submits it separately
ada offers babbage a business/political partnership; he declines
herman hollerith, an employee of the us census bureau, annoyed it took almost 8 years to manually tabulate 1880 census
hollerith gets idea of rail conductors punching holes on ticket
using the punch cards, hollerith completes 1890 census in a year
first major use of electrical circuits to process info
hollerith founds company in 1924: -> (mergers, aquisitions) -> International Business Machines (IBM)
machines by Hollerith and Babbage were digital: calculated using digits
another approach is to model a physical phenomenon and make measurements on analogous model to calculate results: analog machine
Lord Kelvin and James Thomson worked on creating an analog machine to solve diferential equations
used to help create tide charts and artillery trajectory tables
analog machine used a planimeter that can measure area of two-dimensional shape
able to produce tide chart in four hours, but unable to link devices together to solve multivariable eqns
multivariable eqn problem finally mastered in 1931 by Vanevar Bush with his Differential Analyzer; he will later found Raytheon
Differential Analyzer very useful for artillery firing tables
in mid 1930s Tommy Flowers pioneers use of vacuum tubes as on-off switch in electronic circuits
Alan Turing wins scholarship to attend King's College to read mathematics
one of three books he buys with prize money is John vom Neumann's The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
at 1928 conference, Hilbert poses three fundamental questions about any formal system of mathematics
1) was its set of rules complete so that any statement could be proved/disproved using only rules of system?
2) was it consistent so that no statement could be proved true and also proved false?
3) was there some procedure that could determine whether a particular statement was provable, rather than allowing some statement to be unprovable?
within 3 years kurt godel answered first two questions with a no
his incompleteness theorem used self-referential statements
Turing's teacher Max Newman teaches Turing about Hilbert's questions
Turing comes up with Logical Computing Machine as thought experiment
Logical Computing Machine: infinite length of paper tape containing symbols within squares; machine reads symbols and performs actions based on instructions table
Turing went on to show that noncomputable numbers existed, related to the halting problem
halting problem: there can be no method to determine in advance whether any given instruction table combined with inputs will run indefinitely
thus: no mechanical procedure can detrmine the provability of every mathematical statement
Turing's paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" published in 1937
Max Newman sends Turing off to Princeton to study under Alonzo Church
Turing's paper doesn't get much attention
Turing asks mother to send out reprints to Bertrand Russell and some other scholars
only major review is done by Alonzo Church who introduces the term Turing Machine
Claude Shannon applies Boole logic for electrical circuits
relay: a switch that can be opened/shut electrically using an electromagnet
ones that clack open/closed sometimes called electromechanical because they have moving parts
vacuum tubes and transistors can be used as switches in electrical circuits; they're called electronic since they manipulate flow of electrons but do not require movement of physical parts
logic gate: switch that can handle one or more inputs
George Stibitz was working at Bell Labs around same time; uses relays and bulbs to show you could create a calculating machine with them
Bell Labs needed to amplify a phone signal over long distance while filtering out static
solution involved complex numbers
Stibitz gets chance to build machine to help => The Complex Number Calculator completed in 1939
Howard Aiken lobbies Harvard to build a more sophisticated computer to help with calculations
Harvard Mark I built under Howard Aiken after project control transferred to Navy
Mark I was slower but fully automatic

Turing works at Bletchley Park
Grace Hopper, Jean Jennings, and other women program the ENIAC
John von Neumann improves on ENIAC and essentially gets all credit for it
Mauchly and Eckert leave to form Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation -> Rand -> Unisys; they built UNIVAC which is purchased by Census Bureau
von Neumann returns to Princeton and works on a stored program computer
Neumann leaves to join Atomic Energy Commission and group dissolves; this leads to shift of innovation to corporate realm beginning in 1950s
William Shockley leads team at Bell Labs

Jack Kilby joins Texas Instruments; builds the first microchip
Jean Hoerni, a Fairchild physicist places a layer of silicon oxide to protect the transistor
Noyce and Moore start looking into making multiple devices on single piece of silicon
patent battle ensues between Texas Instruments and Fairchild
even if texas instruments were to be awarded a patent for putting multiple components on a single chip, Fairchild hoped to be awarded a patent for making the connections through printed metal lines instead of wires
in April 1961 Noyce was declared the inventor of the microchip
some legal confusion later and Kilby granted patent
Fairchild appeals and wins
Fairchild and Texas Instruments come to a truce and agree to co-license to each other
Kilby and Noyce seen as coinventors
first major market for microchips is military
in 1962 Strategic Air Command designed land-based missile Minuteman II that required two thousands microchips just on onboard guidance system
Navy also buying chips for submarine-launched missile Polaris
first consumer devices to use microchips are hearing aids
Texas Instruments starts working on pocket calculators
fairchild camera and instrument buy fairchild semiconductor and stifle creativity

Licklider recruited to DC to head information processing at DARPA
Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts worked at ARPA (not on friendly terms)
work on ARPA networking project begins, which is eventually named ARPA Net -> ARPANET by Larry Roberts at a conference: Oct 1967
Roger Scantlebury comes up with idea to break messages into small units called packets
the packet idea had been developed independently by Paul Baran at RAND
different methods for sending data through a network:
  circuit switching: similar to a phone system, a set of switches creates a dedicated circuit for signals to go back and forth during conversation and connection remains open
  message switching (aka store-and-forward switching): entire message given address header, sent into network, then passed along from node to node
  packet switching: messages broken into packets, given address headers, then sent to their destinations
Leonard Kleinrock claims credit for packet stuff, other internet founders kinda flip out at such a claim
Larry Roberts sent out soliciation for bids to companies that might want to build the minicomputers that would be sent to each research center to build the minicomputers
contract goes to BBN, team led by Frank Heart and Robert Kahn
Roberts selects four research centers to be the first ARPANET nodes: UCLA, Stanford Research Lab, University of Utah, and UCSB
UCLA grad student Stephen Crocker leads group of grad students on figuring out how their host computers will connect to the standardized ARPANET IMPs
Crocker comes up with idea for 'Request for Comments' or RFC
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) wanted local-area network to connect office work stations
recent Harvard PhD Bob Metcalfe created way to use coaxial cable to create high-bandwidth system that he named "Ethernet"
it was modeled on wireless network developed in Hawaii called ALOHAnet which sent packet data through UHF and satellite signals
there was a packet radio network in San Francisco called PRNET with a satellite version called SATNET
these systems were not compatible so in 1973 Robert Kahn set out to fix that
Kahn worked with Vint Cerf to work on system that was referred to as an "internetwork" later shortened to "internet"
traffic between ARPANET and any other network had to be seamless; they came up with an Internet Protocol (IP) that specified how to put the packet's destination in its header and helped determine how it would travel through networks to get there
layered above the IP was Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that instructed how to put the packets back together in the right order, checked to see if any of them were missing and requested retransmission of any info that had been lost
in July 1945 Vannevar Bush wrote essay for Atlantic titled "As We May Thing" foreseeing a personal machine he dubbed a memex

these ideas would later be advanced by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC
Engelbart demos The Mother of All Demos on Dec 9, 1968
Alan Kay joins Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) run by John McCarthy; isn't a good fit
Kay joins Xerox PARC and eventually works on creating the laptop (initially called Dynabook); he creates Smalltalk for the OS software

The Faith Healers, James Randi
====
3 types of faith:
  intransigent: faith will not be affected by any sort of contrary evidence, no matter how strong
  the will to believe: willful belief where there is insufficient or no evidence either way to make a rational choice
  hypothesis based upon evidence: evidence but not enough evidence or evidence of good enough quality to support total belief
Paracelsus sought medicine in magic
Lourdes healing fountain
laying on of hands originated with nineteenth-century American/European evangelists
Reverend William Branham of Indiana brought modern evangelist/fundamentalist healing movement into existence in the 1940s
doctors and nurses in US have revitalized the International Order of St. Luke the Physician, and Episcopal group stressing a spiritual approach to the practice of medicine
order grew as result of evangelist Oral Roberts's success in the 1950s
evangelist Rex Humbard who began broadcasting in 1952 in Ohio is largely responsible for television format used by faith-healers
Johannes Weyer, sixteenth century physician, also known as Piscinarius, was early skeptic of belief

Charles Monet, Frenchman who lived on private lands of Nzoia Sugar Factory, a plantation in western Kenya, patient zero of virus
Marburg virus is an African organism named for place first discovered (Behring Works factory in Marburg that produced vaccines using kidney cells from African green monkeys)
first person known to be infected by Marburg virus was employee named Klaus F.
Marburg kills 1 in 4
Yellow fever kills 1 in 20
Marburg is one of family of viruses known as filoviruses (thread virus)
most viruses are ball-shaped particles resembing peppercorns
Marburg is the only ring-shaped virus known (resemble Cheerios or a tub of spaghetti when spilled out)
effects of Marburg on brain resemble that of rabies
filoviruses comprises Marburg and two types of Ebola: Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan
Ebola Zaire kill rate is 9 in 10
Marburg has special affinity for eyes and testicles (can linger there for months even after death)
Kasensero one of the first places AIDS appeared
strain that killed Charles Monet is known today as the Musoke strain after the doctor who contracted it from Monet
Ebola virus named for Ebola River
Ebola distantly related to measles, mumps, and rabies
triggers rash all over body
Ebola virus particle contains only seven different proteins
ultraviolet door between Level 1 and Level 2
ultraviolet light smashes virus' genetic material and makes them unable to replicate

Brain Maker: The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brain–for Life, David Perlmutter
====
in nineteenth century Russian-born biologist Elie Mechnikov made link between longevity and healthy balance of bacteria in body
two most common groups of organisms in the gut, forming 90% of bacteria in colon, are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
firmicutes are fat-loving bacteria, equipped with more enzymes to digest complex carbs (more efficient at extracting energy); they increase fat absorption
obese people have elevated levels of firmicutes
two most studied strains of bacteria are Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus
Escherichia coli produces vitamin K but can cause severe illness
Heliobacter pylori causes peptic ulcers but regulates appetite
we're born with Clostridium dificile but it can grow unchecked based on diet
cytokines are small proteins released by cells that affect the behavior of other cells and are often important participants in inflammatory process
C-reactive protein, interleukin six (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor apha (TNF-a) are all cytokines
TNF-a elevated in inflammatory conditions such as Alzheimer's, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, and asthma
elevated blood sugar causes inflammation in the bloodstream and triggers reaction called glycation
glycation: biological process by which sugar binds to proteins and certain fats, resulting in deformed molecules
these sugar proteins are called advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
good gut bacteria are capable of producing important brain chemicals like BDNF, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate
BDNF is involved in neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are created
BDNF also protects existing neurons
Cyrex Array 2: gut permeability test that measures antibodies produced by immune system when confronted by molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
byproduct of mitochondria is production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aka free radicals
free radicals, known for negative effects of aging, also take part in apoptosis (process by which cells undergo self-destruction)
our fingers formed through apoptosis
apoptosis also allows our bodies to rid themselves of cancer cells
cells lacking a nucleus can still commit apoptosis; mitochondria determine whether a cell shall live or die
all of the mitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the female lineage
lower levels of BDNF have been associated with human anxiety and depression
serotonin synthesized from tryptophan
when tryptophan is degraded in body by certain enzymes, it becomes unavailable for production of serotonin
one of byproducts of degraded tryptophan is kynurenine so high levels of kynurenine are good indicator of low tryptophan levels
Bifidobacterium infantis associated with lower levels of kynurenine
people with autism tend to have higher levels of clostridial specials; people with autism tend to crave carbs, especially refined sugars
three main fatty acids produced by gut microbes are acetic, propionic, and butyric acid
clostridial species produce propionic acid (PPA) in abundance
PPA increases gut permeability
individuals with autism are typically deficient in glutathione

in ancient China, Confucian doctrine considered dissection a defilement of the human body and forbade its practice
this was a problem for Huang Ti, Father of Chinese Medicine, who around 2600 BC set out to write authoritative medical and anatomical text
even without dissection Huang Ti was able to figure out that blood of body is under control of the heart and the blood current flows in a continuous circle and never stops
Galen of Imperial Rome also never did a human dissection, but figured some things out through a bunch of animal dissections

rigor mortis is more variable; starts a few hours after death, usually in head and neck, and continues down body disappearing anywhere from ten to forty-eight hours after death
if body has been dead longer than three days, investigators turn to entomological clues (age of fly larvae)
stages of decay
  fresh: involves autolysis (self-digestion)
  bloat: intestinal gas is waste product of bacteria metabolism. once dead, bodies don't expel gas and builds up causing bloat. small intestine is collapsed
         and sealed off. intestines eventually give way
  putrefaction/decay: digestive organs and lungs disintegrate first. brain liquefies next. up until about 3 weeks organs can be identified
skin slip, or gloving, is where skin will come off
by analyzing liquids of human decay in soil you can tell if a body has been moved. if the unique volatile fatty acids and compounds of human decay aren't there, the body didn't decompose there
