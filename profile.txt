Originally from Long Island, I went to school at UMass Amherst for a BS in Computer Science and Math, graduated in 2007 and flew out to San Francisco living there for three years and working at UC Berkeley for most of it. In summer of 2010 I decided to move back to the east coast working at Rent the Runway and gradually do my own thing from there.

The following exchange at a Philz Coffee pretty much sums up my experience interacting with people in San Francisco:

me: Can I get a yellow donut?
barista: Yellow is not a flavor.

My dog Willy is pretty chill; though, sometimes he can be a real Grumpy McGrumpster.

I have my own company, working remotely, building iPhone apps. I spent the past two months driving around the country twice and recently settled back down in NY. (Traveling around the US in two star hotels, I've seen enough ass stains to know that upholstered furniture in a hotel room is a bad idea.)

Currently renting a house in Glen Oaks on the border of Queens and Nassau. Kinda chill, kinda boring.

Sometimes I like to make poor life choices and then break out the mentos.

how each US state could pretty much be its own country.

how much I hate online dating yet how reliant I am on it since I'm too lazy to meet people in person (the working remotely part doesn't help and I could work from a cafe or whatnot, but 1) I have a house to myself so it doesn't really make sense not to utilize it and 2) I find cafes distracting, especially when other people use it as their conference room).

blinking offensive things at people in Morse code.

* you'd like to eventually meet up
* ya like dags
* you're not afraid of one eyed willy (that's my dog, not a euphemism; although, if you are afraid of the euphemism, you're probably not into dudes, in which case, I wouldn't want to waste your time away from the ladies)
<del>* you love axe body spray and hate books</del>

Also, I sometimes refer to my privates as Henrietta and the Majesticals. Just putting that out there. (Should I go with "majesticals" or "majesticles"?)

I'm sure my former much-more-serious profile was a lot better for online dating, but whatever, and, unrelatedly, someone should make a short film in which the serial comma kills its doppleganger, the Oxford comma, for its pretentiousness.

There should really be a way to provide a template [a la github] that shows up when someone goes to send you a message so that there isn't this sort of breaking of the fourth wall where people add notes to their profile based on messages they've received, like "*** No I'm not into threesomes. ***" or "*** Sorry, but I'm not into BDSM. ***". This way I don't have to be aware of all the stupid shit members of my sex send to those of the opposite one.
