questions
    What relationship problems was her sister having?
    What did she say to the fellow nursing student?
    Was the first neighbor watching the scene between 7:00 and 7:27?
    What did the person walking around the car look like?
    The contractor saw person walking wearing jeans, a dark coat, and a light-colored hood. Did the bus driver see what clothes the girl in the car was wearing? Were they the same?

    if your life was in danger and got a call to someone, you'd say help or something, not just sob.
