Operation Nemesis, Eric Bogosian

zapiteh (or zaptiehs): Ottoman Turkish for "policeman"
Mehmet Talat Pasha, leader of Ottoman Empire (which became modern Republic of Turkey) during WWI, assassinated in 1921 in Berlin by young Armenian
    student Soghomon Tehlirian
assassination was act taken by group of Armenian conspirators with headquarters in the US, calling themselves Operation Nemesis
in Constantinople a few weeks later, Muslim Azeri leader Khan Javanshir was gunned down outside the Pera Palace Hotel by Armenian Misak Torlakian
later Said Halim Pasha, former Young Turk Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire was shot dead by Arshavir Shiragian
Shiragian then teamed up with Aram Yerganian to assassinate Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, former head of organization that oversaw genocide of
    Armenians in Turkey, and Djemal Azmi, the notorious former governor-general of Trebizond
around same time Armenian Church was founded circa AD 300, long before Muslim Arabs, Turks, or Mongols invaded, the anti-Christian Diocletian
    steppted down and Emperor Constantine took over the Eastern Roman Empire
in 1313 Constantine issued an edict tolerating the fledgling faith throughout the Roman Empire
Constantine moved the center of the empire to the city of Byzantion and renamed it to Constantinopolis or Constantinople
Ataturk would officially rename the city Instanbul in 1923
3 mains reasons Constantinople grew to be the capital of the empire:
    1) next to Bosphorus, major strait connecting Black Sea to the Mediterranean (gatekeeper to Russia's warm-water ports as well as the Crimea)
    2) one of world's greatest harbors
    3) harbor naturally defensible thanks to rocky heights
Mesrob Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet of 36 letters (2 later added) in 405
introduction of written language triggered cultural renaissance
in 451, Byzantines began to lose their grip on farthest reaches of empire and Persians became dominant power in region
Persians practiced Zoroastrianism and, anomalously, were not fond of other people's religions
on May 26, 451, major battle took place on the Avarayr Plain in Vaspurakan
Armenians lost battle but won the war
Cappadocia has lots of manmade underground tunnels the Christians used to hide from Arab raiders
Arab raiders followed by Seljuk Turks in the 11th century
Seljuk Turks established foothold in Anatolia by defeating Christian Byzantines at Manzikert in 1071; proceeded to disrupt the Byzantine Empire
    by raiding and controlling the territory lying between the major population centers
Islamic Turkish invasion of Byzantium and Holy Lands prompted Byzantines to ask for assistance from the Christians of Europe proper
Crusader knights blessed by pope went into war; at first the knights were successful and managed to occupy Jerusalem
fiefdoms were established up and down the coast and the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, Teutonic Knights, and others became a presence
    in the Middle East
Armenians sided with the Christians
Catholic French and Venetian knights ransacked the holy Byzantine city; 3 day of exquisite murdering, raping, looting, and all-around destruction
priests killed, nuns raped, Library of Constantinople destroyed
by 1200 the Seljuk Turks had solidly installed themselves in Asia Minor
in the 13th century, fiercer Mongols burst on the scene and pwned the Turks
some hundred years later the Mongols relinquished their hold on Anatolia and various Turkish ghazi emirates reestablished themselves
one particular tribe that flourished, Osmanlis, founded by Osman (1258-1326)
in time the Osmanlis controlled all of Anatolia to the east and as far as the Balkans to the west; Europeans called the Osmanlis "Ottomans"
around 1400, Tamurlane invades Armenia and Georgia; over next two years retakes all of Anatolia and defeats Ottoman sultan Bayezid in the Battle
    of Ankara; Tamurlane continued onward to Smyrna and ousted the Knights Hospitallers
in 1453 after two years of preparation Sultan Mehmed "the Conqueror" attacked Constantinople; hammered walls with artillery for weeks on end;
    physically lifted warships out of water, carried overland, and dropped into harbor on other side, attacking from two sides at once and
    succeeding in taking the city
Sultan Mehmed repopulated the city by inviting and forcing people to move there
apogee of imperial Ottoman glory achieved by Suleiman "the Magnificent" almost 100 years after Mehmed the Conqueror took Constantinople
led armies against Europe until advance was checked at Siege of Vienna in 1529
odalisque ogling, that is all
middle of 16th century is clusterfuck with European kingdoms fighting amongst themselves
some wars fought before, during, and after the European Renaissance being the Thirty Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain's war
    with its North American colonies
as the New World was discovered, Europe became rich and with the Industrial Revolution, gained a technical advantage over the Ottoman Empire
in early years of Ottoman epire, most exalted legions of the Ottoman military were the Janissaries, crack military units composed mostly of
    Christian youths harvested from villages of the realm
Janissaries were primary reason for the Ottomans' success in battle and became the germ seed of an elite soldier class that flourished in the
  empire until they wielded outsized power in the civilian, commercial, and political spheres
in 1826 the reigning sultan Mahmud II secretly created new army and destroyed the Janissaries
as a random summarylike footnote, story of Ottoman Empire begins with Osman and ends with Abdul Hamid II
harem area in household where women live and work, men traditionally spent more time in the outer rooms where more public aspects of social life
  take place
part of harem where sultan's hundreds of potential sexual partners resided, a warren of small rooms called seraglio situated alongside the sultan's
  quarters; guarded by black and white eunuchs who were under the command of the kizlar agasi, the chief black eunuch; the kizlar agasi was one of
  the most powerful people in the realm who oversaw women of the harem and was responsible for their care and disposal

    reactor, liquidation of key terrorist leaders in Lebanon and Syria, and successful campain against Iran's secret nuclear weapons program
on Jul 23, 2011, two gunmen on motorcycles mow down Darioush, Rezaei Najad, 35 yr old physics professor working on Iran's nuclear program
on Jan, 12, 2010, Prof. Masoud Ali Mohammadi blown up by bomb when unlocking car door

in 1980s bloody war erupted between Iraq and Iran
Saddam used poison gas against Iranians; Iran starts developing new weapons - biological, chemical, and nuclear - under Khamenei
Iran started doing nuclear reactor deals with China and Russia
Russian and Chinese reactors were just diversions, a smoke screen for world's best secret services
in fall 1987 secret meeting held in Dubai, Iran and Pakistan signed confidential agreement; large sum of money transferred to Pakistanis
    - Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, head of Pakistan's official nuclear weapons program
Dr. Khan needed fissile substances to assemble a nuclear bomb and decided to go with enriched uranium over plutonium
mined uranium core contains only 1% of uranium-235, and 99% of uranium-238 which is about as useless as you know who
Dr. Khan developed a method for converting natural uranium into gas and feeding gas into line of centrifuges connected in a chain
    called a cascade
centrifuges churning uranium gas at 100k spins/min the lighter uranium-235 separates from the heavier uranium-238
by repeating the process thousands of times, the centrifuges produce an enriched uranium-235, which when converted into
    solid matter becomes substance needed for nuclear bomb
Khan  had stolen centrifuge's blueprints from Eurenco, a European company where he worked in the 1970s and then started manufacturing
    his own in Pakistan
Khan soon turned into a merchant of death selling methods, formulas, and centrifuges mostly to Iran, but also Libya and North Korea
on June 1, 1998, American authorities saw true extent of Iranians' work for first time when Pakistani defector appeared before FBI
    (Dr. Iftikhar Khan Chaudhry) and revealed full extent of secret cooperation between Iran and Pakistan
idiot Feds bury transcripts; truth about Iran's nuclear program come to light 4 years later in 2002
in 2002, Iranian underground handed over to CIA a laptop loaded with documents
in Jan 2006, plane crashed in central Iran carrying senior officers in Revolutionary Guards including one of their commanders;
    Iranians maintained crash due to bad weather but Stratfor group hinted that aircraft had been sabotaged by Western agents
in 2008 and 2010 New York Times revealed Tinners, a Swiss family of engineers, helped CIA in exposing nuclear programs of Libya
    and Iran, and were paid $10 million; they sold faulty components to Iranians

    hallucinogenic cigars attempted to produce disorientation and give long, rambling speeches
    contaminated shoes: dust shoes with thallium salts in attempt to make castro lose beard; scrapped when castro cancelled his trip
    depilatory cigars: unable to guarantee only castro would smoke cigars
    poisoned cigars: cigars treated with botulin; agent decided against carrying out plan
    exploding cigars: plan not carried out
    exploding seashells: deemed impractical
    contaminated diving suit: dusted suit with fungus which would produce Madura foot, a chronic skin disease, and contaminated breathing apparatus with tubercle bacillus; plan abandoned
    poisoned pen: Cuban agent AMLASH used Blackleaf-40, decided not to carry out after Kennedy's assassination
    suppressed pistol and rifle: no action taken by AMLASH
in vietnam, seaworthy raft Zodiac became main vehicle for infiltration operations
rafts had cherry top flashers that, when lit from within, were visible in infrared spectrum and could be seen by a T-7 metascope
to get at fuel tanks surrouned by fences, the triple tube rocket launcher (TTL) was invented
rocket launchers had a time delay of a few hours then self-destructed; if enemy found it before it went off, antidisturbance method was added
so if it was tampered with after safety was removed, the device fired and then blew up 1.35 seconds later
firefight simulator resembled collection of fireworks set on a timer

B-3 Dust Powder consisted of powdered tear gas in a squeeze bottle
Puppy Chow was a tranquilizer for dogs with a Syrette filed with antidote if the effects needed to be quickly undone
covert Document Copy Attache Kit contained complete photographic reproduction system concealed inside briefcase
CD rations were created, resembling today's energy bars
throughout early part of vietnam war, Stanley Lovell's .22 caliber silenced Hi-Standard pistol was favorite among CIA and Special Forces
silenced weapons frequently jammed with standard military ammo
too much powder and weapon was noisy; too little and trajectory suffered in velocity/lethality
TSD engineers also updated the OSS Liberator pistol, single-shot .45 caliber handgun designed for large-scale distribution
vietnam edition of Liberator was called the DEAR Gun (DEnied ARea Weapon)
Stinger, a .22 caliber weapon designed to be fired from the palm of the hand at a person sitting in the same room or passing closely in a crowd
Golden Rod concealed a 9mm machine pistol inside an ordinary looking flashlight
Gyrojet pistol was a handheld rocket launcher (powerful but inaccurate/unreliable)
in 1958, CIA pilot Allen Pope was a prisoner in Indonesia; two methods tried to rescue him: collapsible rubber aircraft (plan was scrapped) and Skyhook
Skyhook, an air-ground extraction device, was invented by Robert E. Fulton
they eventually used a submarine to insert two agents on the Indonesian coast and walk Pope out to safety
Fulton's inspiration was the "All American System" tracing its origins back to a mail recovery technique from the 1920s in which pilots
snagged mail pouches suspended between two poles and winched them into the airplane
benjamin franklin forged letter from Germany's Frederick II to King George III advocating more aggressive use of German mercenaries, causing reported 5000 of 30000 Germans to put down their arms
KGB inherited an appreciation and expertise for disinformation from its predecessor organizat, the Okhrana, which in 1903 published The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
fabrication claimed existence of worldwide Jewish conspiracy to create an "intensified centralization of government" and monopolies and "revealed" practice of ritual sacrifice of Christian children in religious ceremonies
in 1959, KGB forgers were consolidated into their own organization when First Chief Directorate created Department D (dezinformatsiya)
KGB used "spydust" (NPPD) to track people
commercial microphones developed in latter quarter of nineteenth century after Emile Berliner sold microphone patent to Bell Telephone Company
world's first electronic eavesdropping system, the Turner Dictograph introdued in 1915, contained a carbon microphone, battery, and earphone
contact microphones are effective in capturing sound waves from room audio that cause every hard surface in the room to vibrate
special type of contact microphone, the accelerometer, could detect vibrations of room conversation or movement through solid concrete walls up to 18 inches thich
vibro-acoustic microphone, designed to be affixed to a reinforcing steel rod or bar inside a concrete column during a building construction could later be connected to concealed wiring that would run to a listening post
pinhole mics were popular
fiber-optical microphone operated using only light waves transmitted to it along a cable thinner than a human hair
directional mics designed for operations to pick up a selected conversation from individuals standing together
rifle mic used in outdoor seating or smoking areas
audio/video surveillance consisted of three main components: collection device, transmission link, listening/observation post
radio-frequency transmitter became the most frequently used device for sending a stolen signal out of a target location
laser microphones worked on the principle that a laser beam directed at an angle toward a glass window was reflected and could be captured at a listening post, compared with the original signal, and demodulated to recover audio
in the 1980s, OTS engineers embedded a small prism inside window glass in key targets, increasing the sensitivity of the laser microphone
a passive resonator concealed inside a wall or piece of furniture can be targeted with a radarlike signal transmitted from an exterior post (The Thing)
robotic catfish used
early in the 1970s, OTS engineers created tiny body-worn receivers to intercept the radio transmissions of Soviet surveillance teams
every agent required his own tailored covcom that fit the circumstances and information involved
every covcom system consisted of three segments: the field set, the transmission backbone, and the receiving element
in 1958, the CIA Chief of Station in Prague, Haviland Smith, developed the brush pass technique
moving-car delivery technique
dead drops are the most commonly used and most secure form of impersonal communication
signal sites were used to initiate a communications sequence between the agent and handler; signals were used to precede or conclude an operation and were normally linked to a specific meeting place or dead drop location
wet systems were a form of secret writing (ex: lemon juice writing revealed by heat from electric light bulb)
two weaknesses of wet systems were requirement of possessing special ink and near impossibility of removing all traces of damage to paper's fibers
dry systems began appearing in 1950s as a variation of carbon typing paper
chemists impregnated special papers with small amounts of chemicals and bound them into common items like journals
the agent would sandwich three pieces of bond paper on top of a piece of glass
top and bottom papers were blank while the middle page was the special carbon paper
agent wrong the message on the top paper and secret chemicals were transferred onto the bottom page
you toss the top and carbon paper(?) and deliver the bottom page to someone
the bottom page is later wet to reveal a message
dry systems quickly became the preferred method of secret writing in the 1960s
microdots and other reduced-image techniques represented a third from of secret writing
a microdot was an optical reduction of a page of text or photographic negative to a size that was illegible without intense magnification
the macrodot was much less secure
dots were usually a last choice since they required the equipment to read them and placing the dot was time consuming
another reduced-image technique involved photography that used a sensitive, fragile emulsion layer of film
the plastic wrap-like substance could be separated from the thicker cellulose base of some types of film
called "soft film" by the KGB, it was one of the most usable methods for clandestine communication even before World War II and saw extensive use throughout the Cold War
Kalvar, a commercial product developed as an alternative to traditional microfilm, represented one of the OTS's most successful special films for reduced-image photography
advantage of Kalvar was that it could be handled and processed in normal room light, did not require special chemicals, and was developed in boiling water
water-soluble paper and flash paper, a form of nitrocellulose, were ways of carrying easily destroyable notes
in the early 1970s OTS developed a secure system that would allow a case officer or tech to record and store operational notes on a tape recorder
the tape recorder had a "third track" recording head
when an agent wanted to record notes, he activated a switch built into the recorder and turned on the secret recording head for the third track
one-time pads (OTPs) used for ciphers
the one-way voice link (OWVL) described a covert communication system that transmitted messages to an agent's unmodified short-wave radio using the high-frequency shortwave bands between 3 and 30 MHz at a predetermined time, date, and frequency
in the late 1970s, OWVL upgraded with development of interim one-way link (IOWL)
used same broadcast stations and network as OWVL but the agent's commercial short-wave radio was replaced by a dedicated IOWL receiver
the self-contained miniature piece of spy gear was a black box about the size of a pack of cigarettes and half as deep, including the internal battery
primary benefit to the agent was the speed of receiving a message; messages that had required listening/transcribing for an hour took ten minutes
short-range agent communications (SRAC systems) represented technical revolution for covcom in 1970s
SRAC enabled agent and case officer to exchange information without being required to come into close proximity
agent carried pocket-sized SRAC in his coat and shot message at designated locations at any time, day or night
vulnerable to signal interception if an opposition service was monitoring the SRAC frequency in the area
CIA recognized potential for using satellites as early as mid-1960s
agent with a small handset could beam info to an orbiting satellite which would relay data to receiving site
by combining satellite-send system with his OWVL, agent could transmit and receive secret intelligence inside home country without personal contact with CIA officer
capability, first deployed in late 1960s under codename BIRDBOOK, used low-earth-orbit satellites as "bent-pipe" relays for agents' messages
agents had only five-to-seven-minute window to shoot the message to satellite and required clear line-of-sight transmission path and precise orientation and positioning of the transmit antenna
opposition developed means to intercept signal and triangulate the agent's position using direction-finding techniques
early CIA version of the flying device from 1976, called the Isectothopter
Phil Zimmerman developed the first version of a public encryption program, PGP, in 1991
advanced version of PGP discovered in September of 2001 during search of apartment of Ana Belen Montes, a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst for Cuban affairs and spy for the Cuban intelligence service

NSA had its roots in WWI
in August 1917, US created MI-8, devoted to deciphering German telegraph signals
unit stayed open after the war inside inconspicuous building in New York City that was called the Black Chamber
unit, Code Compilation Company, monitored suspected subversives
Black Chamber shut down in 1929 after Secretary of State Henry Stimson said "gentlemen blah blah yadda yadda"
practiced was revived in WWII as the Signal Security Agency, later animorphing into the Army Security Agency, then the Armed Forces Security Agency, then in 1952, the National Security Agency
Pentagon's top scientist William Perry took a job at Sylvania Labs in future Silicon Valley to specialize in electronic countermeasures (devices that jammed, diffracted, or disabled those systems)
one of Perry's earliest projects involved intercepting the radio signals guiding a Soviet nuclear warhead to alter its trajectory, which wasn't that effective since the blast would still kill a lot of people
Perry later formed his own company Electromagnetic Systems Laboratory (ESL) in 1964 which did contract work for NSA and CIA
he coined the term counter-C2 warfare, C2 standing for command and control
when the Russians found out about the microwaves emanating from the US embassy's tenth floor they started beaming its windows with their own microwave generators hoping to listen in on American spies' conversations
the KGB was stealing secrets from the Moscow embassy and a device called the Gunman was found inside sixteen IBM Selectric typewriters, which were used by secretaries of high-level embassy officials; the Gunman recorded every one of their keystrokes and transmitted the data to a receiver in a church across the street
the NSA had two main directorates: Signals Intelligence and Information Security (later called Information Assurance)
SIGINT was the active, glamorous side of the puzzle palace: engineers, cryptologists, old-school spies
Information Security (INFOSEC) tested the reliability and security of the hardware and software that the SIGINT teams used
for the most part SIGINT and INFOSEC had no direct contact
most of the NSA worked at Fort Meade, Maryland
INFOSEC was a 22min drive away in a drab brown brick building called FANEX, an annex to the future BWI Marshall Airport
the two entities began to join forces toward the end of Carter's presidency
Computer Security Center created and INFOSEC started testing hardware/software used by both the NSA and Defense Department
after watching Wargames, Reagan asked how vulnerable computer systems were
the presidential directive NSDD-145 was drafted putting the NSA in charge of securing telecommunications and computers
the directive called for the creation of a National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee
it specified that the "National Manager for Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security" would be the NSA director
Congressman Jack Brooks helped pass the Computer Security Act of 1987, which revised the president's directive, denying the agency any such power
during the Gulf War, the Iraqis had lots of antiaircraft missiles and were well trained to use them; the NSA were able to disrupt Iraq's command-control systems and its air-defense radar
in the mid 1980s, there were two groups of NSA SIGINT, A: Soviet Union and its satellites, B: rest of the world
director Mike McConnell learned taht some of the radio receivers around the globe were no longer picking up signals
one of McConnell's aides came into office with two maps: one of the world with major shipping powers: the sea lines of communications (SLOCs)
second map showed lines and densities of fiber-optic cable around the world
to capture digital communication, the main target would be the fiber optic cables
the Computer Security Act of 1987 gave NSA control over the security of military computers and classified networks but irected the National Bureau of Standards, under the Department of Commerce, to handle the rest
McConnell's staff devised the Clipper Chip as a backdoor for commercial voice encryption; died horrible justified death
On June 21, Bill Clinton signed a Presidential Decision Directive, PDD-39, titled "U.S. Policy on Counterterrorism" which put Attorney General Janet Reno in charge of a cabinet committee to review and suggest ways to reduce the vulnerability of government facilities and critical national infrastructure
On June 9, 1997, nsa red team hacked into DoD using only commercially available equipment
On Nov 2, 1988, Moriss worm wreaks havoc
eight man crew Coalition Vulnerability Assessment Team led by 23 year old Matt Devost working out of the Defense Information Systems Agency in Alington, VA carries out attack exercise on various classified systems
NSA's Red Team, part of Information Assurance Directorate, defensive side, stationed in FANEX, building out near Friendship Airport, worked out of a chamber called The Pit, which was so secret few people at NSA knew it existed
Red Team took part in exercise Eligible Receiver June 9–13, 1997, breaking into systems in just 4 days
John Hamre, who had slashed military budgets, stunned by results
on Oct 13, 1997, the Marsh Commission published its report titled Critical Foundations, only briefly alluding to Eligible Receiver
Fight against Milosevic involes a lot of information warfare
NSA deemed increasingly obsolete and needs a revamp
On Jan 24, 2000, NSA's main computer system crashes and stays down for 3 days
Executive report suggests new organization chart for SIGINT Directorate: Global Response, Global Network, Tailored Access
Trailblazer program introduced
NSA's new goal is to tap into fiberoptic cables
The Office of Tailored Operations (TAO) is formed, an elite group of computer programmers
TAO gets better at its craft, developing things like Loudauto, HowlerMonkey, MonkeyCalendar, and Nightstand
CND, CNA, CNE
Computer Network Defense/Attack/Exploitation
General John Abizaid takes helm of US Central Command on July 7, 2003
NSA tries to integrate capabilities with soldiers in the field, providing intel, but politics prevents this from happening (CIA helps cockblock)
Abizaid looks to one-star general Keith Alexander, a tech-competent individual
Abizaid and Alexander look to General Stanley McChrystal, head of JSOC, for help
Hayden and Alexander did not get along; previously, Alexander had requested access to NSA's database and Hayden refused
Hayden referred to Alexander as "the Nike swoosh" (Just do it), due to willingness to do something regardless of legality
Alexander wins over Rumsfeld, who didn't much like Hayden
one week before Alexander arrived at Fort Meade, William Black, Hayden's deputy, pulled the plug on Trailblazer
Trailblazer was an expensive monolithic failure [probably due to being mostly outsourced to contractors]
Alexander and personnel come up with Turbulence program within a year
Turbulence consisted of nine smaller systems
some parts sourced from satellites, microwave, cable communications; other cell phones, others the Internet (on level of data packets)
over ensuing decade, Turbulence matures/splinters into specialized programs (Turbine, Turmoil, QuantumTheory, QuantumInsert, XKeyscore)
in early stages of Turbulence, a parallel program emerges, Real Time Regional Gateway (RTRG), its first mission hunting down insurgents in Iraq
RTRG got under way early in 2007, around same time General David Petraeus assumed command of US forces in Iraq and President Bush ordered a surge in number of forces
roadside bombs were the biggest threat to American soldiers in Iraq
it took sixteen hours for data on bombers to flow to Pentagon, then Fort Meade, then to tech teams for analysis, then back to intel centers in Baghdad, then to soldiers in the field
Alexander proposed putting NSA equipment/analysts in Iraq
on Sept 6, 2007, four Israeli F-15 fighter jets flew over an unfinished nuclear reactor in easern Syria, which was being built with the help of North Korean scientists, and demolished it with a barrage of laser-guided bombs and missiles
the Russian air-defense systems installed in Syria didn't detect the fighter jets
the Israelis managed to pull of the attack (Operation Orchard), because Unit 8200 hacked the Syrian air-defense radar system, using a program called Suter, developed by a US Air Force bureau called Big Safari
Suter didn't disable the radar, instead it disrupted the data link connecting the radar with the screens of radar operators; it also hacked into the screens' video signal so that the Unit 8200 crew could see what the radar operators were seeing
Suter harked back to the Balkan days, ten years earlier, when the Pentagon's J-39 unit, the NSA, and the CIA's Information Operations Center spoofed the Serbian air-defense command by tapping into its communications lines and sending false data to its radar screens
on April 27, 2007, riots broke out in Tallinn, capital of Estonia when Estonia's president, under pressure from Putin, overruled a law that would have removed all the monuments that had gone up during the years of Soviet occupation (Bronze Night riot)
the day after the Bronze Night riot, Estonia hit with massive cyber attack from Russia; for a sporadic three weeks, nearly all systems were down
on August 1, 2008, Ossetian separatists shelled the Georgian village of Tskhinvali; Georgian soliders recapture the town in a few hours
the next day Russian troops and tanks roll into the village, supported by air strikes and a naval blockade
at the precise moment the Russian troops crossed the South Ossetian line, 54 Georgian websites were hacked and rerouted to Russian servers, which shut them down
after four days of fighting, the Georgian army retreated; soon after, Russian's parliament formally recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia and independent states
on March 4, 2007, the Department of Energy conducted an experiment called the Aurora Generator Test
it tested whether or not someone could hack into a control system and cause power outages
a technician typed 21 lines of malicious code into a digital relay, which was wired to a generator
the code opened a circuit breaker in the generator's protection system, then closed it just before the system responded, throwing its operations out of sync; the generator died
two weeks before Aurora Generator Test, Mike McConnell sworn in as director of national intelligence, a new job created just two years earlier, in wake of report by 9/11 Commission concluding that al Qaeda's plot to attack the World Trade Center succeeded because the nation's scattered intelligence agencies-FBI, CIA, NSA, and rest-didn't communicate with one another and so couldn't connect all of the dots
to get cyber on the agenda and make politically import people more aware of issue, McConnell took a memo someone had written a few weeks ago, showed it to them, told them the Chinese hacked it from their computer and the NSA hacked it back from the Chinese computer
McConnel makes point to people in meeting with Bush and advisors that had the 9/11 hijackers been cyber smart they could've hacked into the servers of one major bank in NYC and contaminated its files, inflicting more economic damage than they'd doen by taking down the Twin Towers
Bush, infuriated, tells McConnell he has 30 days to fix the issue of cyber defense
looking into the issue of protecting civilian networks, they find that it's way more complicated due to all the access points
in 2004, in its second year of operations, the Homeland Security Department put out a contract for a government-wide intrustion-detections ystem called Einstein, the the task proved unwieldly
McConnell and Hathaway put in motion a program called Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), which called for creation of a supra-agency that would consolidate government's scattered servers into a single "Federal Enterprise Network," set strict security standards, and whittle down the points of entry to the Internet from over 4000 to just 50
on Jan 9, 2008, Bush signed a national security presidential directive, NSPD-54, which cited the dangers posed by America's cyber vulnerabilities and ordered Hathaway's plan into action as a remedy
which legal statutes authorized which sets of activites: Title 50 for intelligence, Title 10 for military operations, Title 18 for criminal probes
Homeland Security upgraded to Einstein 2 and started planning for Einstein 3; NSA took on these projects as part of share of the 17.3 billion they got from NSPD-54
after coming on board, Alexander backed out, explaining that the civilian agencies' requirements and Homeland Security's approach were incompatible; the Einstein project falls apart after NSA leaves
on Oct 24, 2008, a beacon was emitting a signal from inside CentCom's classified computers; TAO reroutes the agent.btz to a different place; this operation was called Buckshot Yankee
Buckshot yankee drove the point home that the NSA had its shit together and came out ahead of the Pentagon
Mike McConnell pushes Bob Gates to unify Cyber Command with the NSA at Fort Meade
Alexander was supposedly (untrue) about to retire (past the typical 3 year term for director) and Gates figured making NSA director also director of Cymber Command would help keep Alexander out of retirement
on June 23, 2009, Gates signs memorandum, ordering creation of U.S. Cyber Command
on October 31, 2010, U.S. Cyber Command raised its flag at Fort Meade
in the late 1990s, Richard Clarke learned that 80 percent of global internet traffic passed through jsut two buildings in the US: one called MAE West in San Jose, CA and the other MAE East in Tysons Corner, VA; he entered the rooms with a secret service agent and found it trivial to wreak havoc
since most of the traffic passed through the US, you could just tap foreign comms in the US
there was a legal obstacle since back in the 1970s, Senator Frank Church uncovered massive abuse by the CIA and NSA, leading to the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, which barred domestic surveillance without evidence of probable cause that the target was an agent of a foreign power and that the places of surveillance were used by that agent and even then the govt would have to present the evidence to a FISA court; the president could authorize surveillance without a court order, but onlly if the attorny general certified under oath that the target was believed to be a foreign agent and that the eavesdropping would not pick up communications of a US person, defined as an American citizen, permanent resident, or corporation
the Patriot Act expanded foreign agents to include terrorist groups [with no affiliation to a nation-state]
VeriSign map gets senators' attention for justifying including US citizens in data collection
in early August, 2007, the bill, labeled Protect America Act, that notes electronic surveillance of an American would not be illegal-would not even be defined as electronic surveillance-if it was aimed at a person who was reasonably believed to be located outside of the US
another passage specifies that the govt can obtain the info only with assistance of a communications service provider; this allowed NSA to retrieve data from private corporations and gave corporations legal cover to cooperate with NSA
only limit the bill placed on surveillance was that the data acquired from Americans had to be minimized (no names or contents)
Mike McConnell replaced first week of Obama's presidency; Hathaway gone by August
a few days before inauguration, Bush briefed Obama on Olympic Games, later known as Stuxnet
Stuxnet spreads outside of Natanz
Symantec in CA, VirusBlokAda in Belarus, Kaspersky Lab in Russia start studying the Stuxnet worm
German security researcher Ralph Langner infers that someone was trying to disable the Natanz nuclear reactor in Iran and that Israelis were probably involved
in Obama's first year as president, around fourth of july, North Korea launched DOS shutting down websites of DHS, Treasury, Transportation, Secret Service, FTC, NYSE, NASDAQ, and dozens of South Korean banks
Stuxnet spurred Iranians to create their own cyber war unit; they created their own Shamoon virus, wiping out 30k hard drives at Saudi Aramco
Obama orders drafting of new presidential policy directive PPD-20 US Cyber Operations Policy assessing aims/risks/benefits/consequences of attacks, signed in Oct 2012
in April 2007, Colonel Gregory Rattray summoned several executives from largest us defense contractors and informed them they needed to stop being so passive to china's stealing of trade secrets, etc.; coined the term APT (advaned persistent threat) to describe the hackers' actions
on Jun 6 2013, the washington post and the guardian reported on PRISM
on Aug 27, 2013, the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies met in the White House Situation Room with the president, Susan Rice, and the heads of the intelligence agencies; Obama gave the group a deadline of Dec 15; their job was provide analysis of cyber policy and provide better alternatives if possible
for all of 2012, the NSA queried the database for 288 US phone numbers; as a result, they passed on twelve "tips" to the FBI; of the 12, 0 led to the halting of a plot or the capture of a terrorist
General Alexander publicly claimed that PRISM had helped discover and disrupt the planning of 54 terrorist attacks
if a terrorist in Pakistan called a terrorist in Yemen, the NSA could intercept their conversation, but if they same two people were talking on a cell phone in the same overseas location, the NSA would have to get a warrant from the FISA court; that's why McConnell pushed for a revision in the law and what led to the Protect America Act of 2007, which allowed the govt to conduct electronic surveillance inside the US as long as the people communicating were "reasonably believed" to be outside the US
the PRISM intercept could legally get under way once there was a 52% probability that both parties to the call/email were foreign-based
if, once the intercept began, it turned out the parties were inside the US, the operation had to be shut down immediately and all data thus far retrieved destroyed
the panel determined that even if the NSA hadn't collected all the metadata related to a terrorist's phone number, the NSA or FBI would still have uncovered those plots
panel begins jokingly referring to themselves as The Five Guys and working on The Five Guys Report
one of their key recommendations was that all metadata should be removed from Fort Meade and held by the private telecom companies or some third party, with the NSA allowed access only through a FISA Court order
another proposal was to bar the FBI from issuing National Security Letters without a FISA Court order and, in any case, letting recipients disclose that they'd received such a letter after 180 days, unless a judge extended the term of secrecy for specific national security reasons
the group also wrote that the FISA Court should include a public interest advocate, that NSA directors should be confirmed by the Senate, that they should not take on the additional post of US cyber commander and that the Information Assurance Directorate should be split off from the NSA and turned into a separate agency of the Defense Department
another recommendation was to bar the govt from doing anything to "subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable generally available commercial software"
on Jan 2014 Obama announced a set of new policies prompted by the report; president ignored the Review Group's proposal to split the NSA from Cyber Command; he rejected the proposal to require FISA Court orders from the FBI's NSLs but did limit how long the letters could remain secret (180 days); he ordered NSA to restrict data searches to two hops and endorsed the proposal to store the metadata with a private entity
on May 7, US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Setion 215 of the Patriot Act did not authorize anything so broad as NSA's bulk metadata collection program and deemed it illegal
the House and Senate would have to take a vote on Section 215
moderates in Congress drafted a bill called the USA Freedom Act which would keep metadata stored with the telecom companies and allow the NSA access to only narrowly specified pieces of it and only after obtaining a FISA Court order
Congress approved the main reforms of NSA practices as recommended by Obama's commission
Geoffrey Stone delivers speech at Fort Meade: "I found, to my surprise, that the NSA deserves the respect and appreciation of the American people. But it should never, ever, be trusted."
on Feb 10, 2014, Islamic Republic of Iran launched massive cyber attack against the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, destroying hard drives, stealing thousands of credit cards and names and SSNs of employees
Sheldon Adelson, pro-Israel right-winger who owned 52 percent of Las Vegas Sands stock, a month earlier had made a comment about nuclear negotiations with Iran that royally pissed them off apparently
on Nov 24, 2014, gang of hackers called Guardians of Peace hack into Sony Pictures
Sony contacts FBI, FireEye to track down hacker; group called "DarkSeoul" identified, which often did cyber jobs for the North Korean govt
Obama expresses disappointment over Sony not releasing movie and giving into blackmail
on Dec 22, 2014, three days after Obama talked about the Sony hack, someone disconnected North Korea from the Internet

How Linux Works, Brian Ward
====
when a process calls fork(), the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process
when a process calls exec(program), the kernel starts program, replacing the current process
other than init, all user processes on a linux system start as a result of fork(), and most of the time, you also run exec() to start a new program instead of running a copy of an existing process (i.e. you fork and then exec)
find sysfs location of a device in /dev: udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/sda
user space startup:
    init
    essential low-level services (e.g. udevd, sys-logd)
    network configuration
    mid- and high-level services (e.g. cron, printing)
    login prompts, GUIs, and other high-level applications
three implementations of init:
    System V
    systemd
    Upstart
System V and other older versions relied on a sequence that performed only one startup task at a time; this made it easy to resolve dependencies but performance wasn't very good
getty is a program that attaches to terminals and displays a login prompt


The Secret Sentry, Matthew Aid
====
in a sense Brigadier General Carter Clarke was the founding father ot the NSA
Clarke's Special Branch was a part of the Army G-2 in the Pentagon created after Pearl Harbor, the unit to which all intercepts were sent for analysis
the army's SIGINT organization, the Signal Security Agency (SSA), was a separate field agency that was (until 1944) part of the Army Signal Corps
when Clarke took command of the Special Branch of Army G-2 in May 1942, they were able to read the top Japanese comms helping win the battle of Midway
they worked with Britain's Bletchley Park
the US was reading the codes of more than 40 countries, including allies and the Axis
before the end of the war Clarke knew the Soviet Union would be the next main enemy and ordered to begin cracking Russian codes in Jan 1943
the Navy had its own code-breaking operations headquartered in Washington
Russians were doing a better job than everyone else
in Oct 1943, Richard Hallock made first break into Russian ciphers (Russians were reusing their one time pads)
Russian intelligence changes:
    1922-1923: after postrevolutionary Cheka, it became the State Political Directorate (GPU)
    1923-1934: United State Political Directorate (OGPU)
    1934-1943: Main Directorate for State Security (GUGB)
    1943-1946: People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB)
    1946-1953: Ministry for State Security (MGB)
    1953-1954: Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD)
    1954-1991: Committee for State Security (KGB)
    Oct 1991: KGB dissolved following collapse of the USSR and the abortive coup against Mikhail Gorbachev
on Sept 1945, the SSA was redesignated as the Army Security Agency (ASA)
super-secret intercept program known as Operation Gold: in May 1946, two years before the creation of the state of Israel, the US Navy COMINT org began intercepting the international telephone calls and cable traffic of Jewish agents in the US who were engaged in raising money and buying arms for the Jewish underground in Palestine
On March 5, 1946, Winston Churchill delivers famous speech in Fulton, Missouri warning about the Iron Curtain
informal war time arrangements between American and British COMINT formalized on same day
as Churchill has delivering his speech, a group of Senior American and British intelligence officials were signing a Top Secret intelligence-sharing agreement called the British-United States Communication Intelligence Agreement (BRUSA Agreement)
there was to be a free and complete exchange of information between Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the US orgs
other SIGINT allies-Canada, Australia, New Zealand-referenced in agreement
in 1954 BRUSA morphs into United Kingdom-United States (UKUSA) Agreement
on Sept 5, 1945, Russian cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko walked out of Russian embassy in Ottawa and defected to Canada
info from Gouzenko helped the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identify seventeen spies working for the Soviet military intelligence service (GRU) in Canada and Britain
Richard Pritchard headed GCHQ
during the 1948 Berlin Crisis, it was COMINT that showed the Soviets had no intention of launching an attack on West Berlin or West Germany
on June 26, 1948, the Soviets cut off all access to West Berlin, forcing the US and Britain to begin massive airlift to keep West Berlin supplied with foodstuffs and coal for heating
on Friday, October 29, 1948, just as Truman was preparing to give a speech at Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City, the Russian government and military executed a massive change of virtually all of their cipher systems. This day was later known as Black Friday
US/UK cryptanalysts would be unable to decrypt more complicated ciphers until tenure of Admiral Bobby Ray Inman in the late 1970s
Russian military and key Soviet government ministries began encrypting their telephone calls using a newly developed voice scrambling device called Vhe Che (High Frequency)
Russians made massive shift because William Weisband, forty-year-old Russian linguist with ASA, told the KGB everything he knew
on Oct 20 1948, newly independent US Air Force formally activated its own COMINT, the US Air Force Security Service (USAFSS)
CIA had been created in 1947
between December 1948 and June 1950, Meredith Gardner decrypted portions of Soviet Venona ciphers that helped the FBI identify Judith Coplon, Julius Rosenberg, Klaus Fuchs, Donald MacLean, David Green-glass, Julius Rosenberg, and Theodore Alvin Hall; only 15 of the 206 Soviet agents identified in the Venona decrypts were prosecuted
forty individuals identified as having spied for Russia fled before they could be prosecuted, including MacLean, Guy Burgess, and Kim Philby
by 1950 COMINT was looking pretty weak
there was no COMINT on North Korea before the Korean War broke out (they just weren't a priority over the USSR)
on June 28, 1950, Seoul fell to the North Korean invasion [without a fight] three days after it began
North Korea was incompetent with COMINT and all of their military tactical codes and ciphers were broken
with COMINT compromised, North Korea essentially got owned
AFSA was able to read the cable traffic of best informed foreign diplomat based in Beijing, Dr. Kavalam Madhava Panikkar, India's ambassador to China
intercepts of Panikkar's cables to New Delhi in July/August 1940 revealed he had been told by Chou Enlai that the Chinese would not intervene militarily in Korea
decrypted cables of the Burmese ambassador in Beijing warned that China now intended to become militarily involved in Korea
on Sept 25, Chou Enlai warned Indian ambassador that China would intervene if UN forces crossed the 38th parallel
Panikkar's reporting was discounted/ignored, but China wasn't bluffing
on Oct 1 South Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel; the next day, Mao Tsetung ordered 260,000 Chinese troops to begin crossing the Yalu River on October 15
on Oct 15-16, China enters the Korean War
it was discovered the Russians were actually controlling the air defense of North Korea and Manchuria
on June 13, 1952, President Truman welcomed CIA director Walter Smith and executive secretary of the NSC James Lay to Oval Office; Smith gave Truman a copy of a Top Secret Codeword report on the state of health of the US national SIGINT effort, the much-anticipated Brownell Report of AFSA
the Brownell Committee called for a complete overhaul and reorganization of AFSA => The NSA is born
Eisenhower sworn in on Jan 20, 1953
Stalin dies on Mar 4, 1953
Eisenhower annoyed news came from AP and Moscow as opposed to SIGINT
1956, year of crisis:
    violent worker riots take place in Polish city of Poznan and crushed by Polish troops
    riots break out in Budapest
NSA SIGINT picked up that there were Russians prepped to go around virtually every major Hungarian city
Israel attacks Egyptian forces in Gaza strip
25, 000 Hungarians killed in uprising
USAFSS Russian linguist listing to transmission of a MiG trying to shoot down a U-2 plane discovered the engine crapped out at a certain altitude
on May 1, 1960, a surface-to-air missile (SAM) shoots down a U-2 plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers
on Jan 20, 1961, JFK sworn in as 35th president
at the time NSA had a budget of $654M, while CIA had a budget of $401.6M
Jack Frost was a disaster as head of NSA (not on good terms with Kennedy administration among other things)
by 1962 McNamara fired Frost
by July 1962, SIGINT showed that the Cuban MiG fighters were now routinely conducting ground-controlled intercept (CGI) air defense exercises and on two occasions intercepted intruding aircraft, clear evidence that the Cuban air force was fast becoming combat ready
NSA was able to tap into the Cuban national telephone system; this was possible because the American telecommunications giant RCA International had built the system in 1957 and it used vulnerable micro wave relay system rather than invulnerable landlines to carry virtually all telephone traffice between Havana and all major towns and cities in Cuba
in 1960, the Soviets began to replace the American-made equipment with Russian communications and crypographic equipment; NSA estimated it would take them about two years to replace it but with the lack of spare parts blah blah blah, they'd just stick with the American system
a "burst" transmission is one in which the message is compressed electronically and the information packed into the "burst" takes only seconds to be transmitted and received
SIGINT detected four Soviet Foxtrot-class attack submarines departing Northern Fleet naval bases on the Kola Peninsula
U-2 imagery showed the Russians had accelerated their work on completing the ballistic missile sites in Cuba
Cuban saboteurs blew up four electrical substations in western Venezuela

two rival tribes in Pakistan: the Mehsuds and the Wazirs
Mehsud were dubbed the wolves due to their ferociousness
the Wazirs were at peace with the Pakistani government and more interested in fighting the US in Afghanistan
the CIA were more interested in the Wazirs until the NSA picked up a phone call that Baitullah Mehsud of the Mehsud had a nuclear weapon; it was concluded he had a dirty bomb
Baitullah Mehsud had attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team and a police academy in Lahore
Baitullah killed and replaced by his more capable cousin Hakimullah
Baitullah was nurturing a Jordanian jihadi doctor and blogger named Humam Balawi, who convinced Jordanian intelligence he was a double agent
Balawi was invited to CIA base Khost, blew up seven CIA
Hakimullah later killed, but it helped increase Mehsud's rivals, the Haqqanis
Hakimullah's replacement was Maulana Fazlullah known as Mullah Radio for pronouncing beheadings for infractions of sharia law such as polio vaccinations

Anwar al-Awlaki added to CIA's kill list in April 2011, meanwhile everyone knew where he was and no one arrested him
Justice Department lawyers cook up justification for killing Awlaki
the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in Dec 2006 that targeted preventions would be legal in certain cases when absolutely necessary, but, according to IDF whistle-blower Anat Kamm, the Israeli military routinely disregarded the judgement anyway; Kamm sentenced to 4.5 years in prison
Awlaki killed in Sep 2011 and his son killed two weeks later at a restaurant where a high-value target Ibrahim al-Banna was thought to be eating
Awlaki was a target due to connection to two failed attempts to explode bombs on American planes, and his mentoring of Nidal Malik Hasan, the army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas in Nov 2009
Saleh hands the land to al-Qaeda and then starts bombing them along with the US

General Atomics got 2 billion from the Pentagon in 2013 (0.68% of US defense contracts that year), small compared to 37 billion brought in by leading contractor Lockheed Martin
prime contractors, the five giant firms that emerged from mergers of early 1990s, not interested in General Atomics' drones since they didn't net that much per unit
RQ-180, like the Beast, operated jointly by the air force and CIA
the RQ-180 was just surveillance; a drone designed to do a bunch of things was desired so the US Navy put out a 3.7 billion contract
in 2009 Shia insurgents in Iraq used SkyGrabber software (29.95) to capture and download Predator video feeds
in Dec 2011 an RQ-170 landed in Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard put it on display

before the soviet union invaded afghanistan, it was a pretty progressive hippie friendly place (communists) [1950s]
April 1978: Communists rally against government [under dictator Daud Khan] for killing leader Mir Akbar Khyber
Communists stage coup, kill Khan
Christmas Eve 1979: Soviets invade
Even before the soviets invaded, it was pretty much the Muslim Brotherhood [in the outskirts] and the Communists
once soviets invade, the Islamist insurgents (mujahadeen) unite against soviets
soviets vs. us, pakistan, saudi arabia
afghani boys educated in pakistan and fed extreme violent version of islam
soviets withdraw in 1989
soviet union collapses in 1991, aid to proxies ceases, afghan government collapses

Walter Cannon focused on adaptive aspect of stress-response in dealing with emergencies
Hans Selye formalized the ill effects of stress with ulcerated rat experiment
autonomic nervous system includes sympathetic and parasympathetic systems
sympathetic: fight, flight, fright, sex
parasympathetic: chill
"safety features" exist so that parts of the brain that trigger sympathetic inhibit the parasympathetic and vice versa
neural route represented by sympathetic system is first means to mobilize response to stressor
another way is through secretion of hormones
if a neuron secretes a chemical messenger that travels and causes next cell in line to do something different, that messenger is a neurotransmitter
if a neuron secretes a messenger that instead percolates into the bloodstream, that messenger is a hormone
used to be believed that testicles secrete less testosterone with age
wealthy people would get injected with testicular extracts from other animals [and could even pick the animal]
this led to organotherapy: grafting of little bits of testes
in 1944 Geoffrey Harris proposes that brain is also a hormonal gland
Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally start looking for these brain hormones
14 years later, the chemical structure of the first releasing hormone is published
they get the Nobel Price in 1976
the hypothalamus contains a huge array of releasing and inhibiting hormones
two hormones vital to stress-response are epinephrine and norepinephrine released by sympathetic nervous system
another important class of hormones in response to stress are glucocorticoids
glucocorticoids are steroid hormones
steroid is used to describe general chemical structure of five classes of hormones: androgens (anabolic), estrogens, progestins, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids
secreted by the adrenal gland, often act similar to epinephrine
epinephrine acts within seconds, glucocorticoids back this up over course of minutes or hours
a putative hormone is referred to as a factor until its chemical structure is confirmed (ex: CRF -> CRH)
CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) triggers pituitary to release hormone ACTH (corticotropin)
ACTH is released into bloodstream, reaches adrenal gland, and triggers glucocorticoid release
in times of stress pancreas is stimulated to release hormone glucagon
glucocorticoids, glucagon, and the sympathetic nervous system raise circulating levels of sugar glucose
pituitary also secretes prolactin, which suppresses reproduction during stress
pituitary and brain secrete class of endogenous morphine-like substances called endorphins and enkephalins which help blunt pain perception
pituitary also secretes vasopressin, aka antidiuretic hormone, which plays role in cardiovascular stress-response
sympathetic arousal is a relative marker of anxiety and vigilance
heavy secretion of glucocorticoids is more a marker of depression

ada byron (=> lovelace) daughter of poet lord byron
ada lovelace meets charles babbage
charles babbage builds a Difference Engine, which can solve polynomial equations
at Cambridge, Babbage along with John Herschel and George Peacock form a club called Analytical Society
Analytical Society campaigned to get university to abandon Newton's dot notation calculus and replace with Leibniz' dx/dy notation
in 1640s, Blaise Pascal created mechanical calculator for tax purposes
Leibniz tries to improve it with multiplication/division (does not completely succeed due to not being an engineer)
Babbage and hired engineer not quite skilled enough to get Difference Engine working
Babbage dreams up something else: The Analytical Machine
Analytical Machine is the product of what Ada Lovelace, in her essay on imagination, called "the Combining Faculty"
Babbage applies the automated loom, invited in 1801 by Joseph-Marie Jacquard
Babbage unable to get funding from British government
Babbage meets future prime minister of Italy Menabrea who publishes description of Analytical Machine in French
ada adds translation and "Notes by the Translator"; the notes become more famous than the article itself
notes make ada destined to become iconic figure in history of computing
in ada's notes she explores 4 concepts
1) a general-purpose machine, one that could perform a preset task but could be programmed and reprogrammed to do limitless and changeable array of tasks
2) the machine could store, manipulate, process, and act upon anything that could be expressed in symbols
3) figure out in step-by-step detail the workings of a program/algorithm (used Bernoulli numbers as example)
4) machines cannot think (later dubbed "Lady Lovelace's Objection" by Alan Turing)
babbage wanted ada to push the govt for funding
ada refuses, babbage then writes an attack against govt and cowardly asks ada to include it in her notes
babbage sends appendage anyway and they reply telling him to man up and submit it separately with his name
babbage asks ada not to send her notes; she refuses and he backs down and submits it separately
ada offers babbage a business/political partnership; he declines
herman hollerith, an employee of the us census bureau, annoyed it took almost 8 years to manually tabulate 1880 census
hollerith gets idea of rail conductors punching holes on ticket
using the punch cards, hollerith completes 1890 census in a year
first major use of electrical circuits to process info
hollerith founds company in 1924: -> (mergers, aquisitions) -> International Business Machines (IBM)
machines by Hollerith and Babbage were digital: calculated using digits
another approach is to model a physical phenomenon and make measurements on analogous model to calculate results: analog machine
Lord Kelvin and James Thomson worked on creating an analog machine to solve diferential equations
used to help create tide charts and artillery trajectory tables
analog machine used a planimeter that can measure area of two-dimensional shape
able to produce tide chart in four hours, but unable to link devices together to solve multivariable eqns
multivariable eqn problem finally mastered in 1931 by Vanevar Bush with his Differential Analyzer; he will later found Raytheon
Differential Analyzer very useful for artillery firing tables
in mid 1930s Tommy Flowers pioneers use of vacuum tubes as on-off switch in electronic circuits
Alan Turing wins scholarship to attend King's College to read mathematics
one of three books he buys with prize money is John vom Neumann's The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
at 1928 conference, Hilbert poses three fundamental questions about any formal system of mathematics
1) was its set of rules complete so that any statement could be proved/disproved using only rules of system?
2) was it consistent so that no statement could be proved true and also proved false?
3) was there some procedure that could determine whether a particular statement was provable, rather than allowing some statement to be unprovable?
within 3 years kurt godel answered first two questions with a no
his incompleteness theorem used self-referential statements
Turing's teacher Max Newman teaches Turing about Hilbert's questions
Turing comes up with Logical Computing Machine as thought experiment
Logical Computing Machine: infinite length of paper tape containing symbols within squares; machine reads symbols and performs actions based on instructions table
Turing went on to show that noncomputable numbers existed, related to the halting problem
halting problem: there can be no method to determine in advance whether any given instruction table combined with inputs will run indefinitely
thus: no mechanical procedure can detrmine the provability of every mathematical statement
Turing's paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" published in 1937
Max Newman sends Turing off to Princeton to study under Alonzo Church
Turing's paper doesn't get much attention
Turing asks mother to send out reprints to Bertrand Russell and some other scholars
only major review is done by Alonzo Church who introduces the term Turing Machine
Claude Shannon applies Boole logic for electrical circuits
relay: a switch that can be opened/shut electrically using an electromagnet
ones that clack open/closed sometimes called electromechanical because they have moving parts
vacuum tubes and transistors can be used as switches in electrical circuits; they're called electronic since they manipulate flow of electrons but do not require movement of physical parts
logic gate: switch that can handle one or more inputs
George Stibitz was working at Bell Labs around same time; uses relays and bulbs to show you could create a calculating machine with them
Bell Labs needed to amplify a phone signal over long distance while filtering out static
solution involved complex numbers
Stibitz gets chance to build machine to help => The Complex Number Calculator completed in 1939

Mauchly and Eckert leave to form Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation -> Rand -> Unisys; they built UNIVAC which is purchased by Census Bureau
von Neumann returns to Princeton and works on a stored program computer
Neumann leaves to join Atomic Energy Commission and group dissolves; this leads to shift of innovation to corporate realm beginning in 1950s

Jack Kilby joins Texas Instruments; builds the first microchip
Jean Hoerni, a Fairchild physicist places a layer of silicon oxide to protect the transistor
Noyce and Moore start looking into making multiple devices on single piece of silicon
patent battle ensues between Texas Instruments and Fairchild
even if texas instruments were to be awarded a patent for putting multiple components on a single chip, Fairchild hoped to be awarded a patent for making the connections through printed metal lines instead of wires
in April 1961 Noyce was declared the inventor of the microchip
some legal confusion later and Kilby granted patent
Fairchild appeals and wins
Fairchild and Texas Instruments come to a truce and agree to co-license to each other
Kilby and Noyce seen as coinventors
first major market for microchips is military
in 1962 Strategic Air Command designed land-based missile Minuteman II that required two thousands microchips just on onboard guidance system
Navy also buying chips for submarine-launched missile Polaris
first consumer devices to use microchips are hearing aids
Texas Instruments starts working on pocket calculators
fairchild camera and instrument buy fairchild semiconductor and stifle creativity
many leave; Jean Hoerni and 3 others leave to start Teledyne funded by Arthur Rock

Licklider comes up with idea for "Libraries of the Future"
Licklider recruited to DC to head information processing at DARPA
Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts worked at ARPA (not on friendly terms)
work on ARPA networking project begins, which is eventually named ARPA Net -> ARPANET by Larry Roberts at a conference: Oct 1967
Roger Scantlebury comes up with idea to break messages into small units called packets
the packet idea had been developed independently by Paul Baran at RAND
different methods for sending data through a network:
  circuit switching: similar to a phone system, a set of switches creates a dedicated circuit for signals to go back and forth during conversation and connection remains open
  message switching (aka store-and-forward switching): entire message given address header, sent into network, then passed along from node to node
  packet switching: messages broken into packets, given address headers, then sent to their destinations
Leonard Kleinrock claims credit for packet stuff, other internet founders kinda flip out at such a claim
Larry Roberts sent out soliciation for bids to companies that might want to build the minicomputers that would be sent to each research center to build the minicomputers
contract goes to BBN, team led by Frank Heart and Robert Kahn
Roberts selects four research centers to be the first ARPANET nodes: UCLA, Stanford Research Lab, University of Utah, and UCSB
UCLA grad student Stephen Crocker leads group of grad students on figuring out how their host computers will connect to the standardized ARPANET IMPs
Crocker comes up with idea for 'Request for Comments' or RFC
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) wanted local-area network to connect office work stations
recent Harvard PhD Bob Metcalfe created way to use coaxial cable to create high-bandwidth system that he named "Ethernet"
it was modeled on wireless network developed in Hawaii called ALOHAnet which sent packet data through UHF and satellite signals
there was a packet radio network in San Francisco called PRNET with a satellite version called SATNET
these systems were not compatible so in 1973 Robert Kahn set out to fix that
Kahn worked with Vint Cerf to work on system that was referred to as an "internetwork" later shortened to "internet"
traffic between ARPANET and any other network had to be seamless; they came up with an Internet Protocol (IP) that specified how to put the packet's destination in its header and helped determine how it would travel through networks to get there
layered above the IP was Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that instructed how to put the packets back together in the right order, checked to see if any of them were missing and requested retransmission of any info that had been lost
in July 1945 Vannevar Bush wrote essay for Atlantic titled "As We May Thing" foreseeing a personal machine he dubbed a memex

these ideas would later be advanced by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC
Engelbart demos The Mother of All Demos on Dec 9, 1968
Alan Kay joins Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) run by John McCarthy; isn't a good fit
Kay joins Xerox PARC and eventually works on creating the laptop (initially called Dynabook); he creates Smalltalk for the OS software

  the will to believe: willful belief where there is insufficient or no evidence either way to make a rational choice
  hypothesis based upon evidence: evidence but not enough evidence or evidence of good enough quality to support total belief
Paracelsus sought medicine in magic
Lourdes healing fountain
laying on of hands originated with nineteenth-century American/European evangelists
Reverend William Branham of Indiana brought modern evangelist/fundamentalist healing movement into existence in the 1940s
doctors and nurses in US have revitalized the International Order of St. Luke the Physician, and Episcopal group stressing a spiritual approach to the practice of medicine
order grew as result of evangelist Oral Roberts's success in the 1950s
evangelist Rex Humbard who began broadcasting in 1952 in Ohio is largely responsible for television format used by faith-healers
Johannes Weyer, sixteenth century physician, also known as Piscinarius, was early skeptic of belief

Charles Monet, Frenchman who lived on private lands of Nzoia Sugar Factory, a plantation in western Kenya, patient zero of virus
Marburg virus is an African organism named for place first discovered (Behring Works factory in Marburg that produced vaccines using kidney cells from African green monkeys)
first person known to be infected by Marburg virus was employee named Klaus F.
Marburg kills 1 in 4
Yellow fever kills 1 in 20
Marburg is one of family of viruses known as filoviruses (thread virus)
most viruses are ball-shaped particles resembing peppercorns
Marburg is the only ring-shaped virus known (resemble Cheerios or a tub of spaghetti when spilled out)
effects of Marburg on brain resemble that of rabies
filoviruses comprises Marburg and two types of Ebola: Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan
Ebola Zaire kill rate is 9 in 10
Marburg has special affinity for eyes and testicles (can linger there for months even after death)
Kasensero one of the first places AIDS appeared
strain that killed Charles Monet is known today as the Musoke strain after the doctor who contracted it from Monet
Ebola virus named for Ebola River
Ebola distantly related to measles, mumps, and rabies
triggers rash all over body
Ebola virus particle contains only seven different proteins
ultraviolet door between Level 1 and Level 2
ultraviolet light smashes virus' genetic material and makes them unable to replicate
negative air pressure designed to keep hot agents from drifting outward
first line of defense against a hot agent is sticky tape because it seals cracks
July 6 1976: Mr. Yu G. first identified case in outbreak of unknown virus (later known as Ebola Sudan)
Ebola Sudan lethality comparable to Black Plague
to this day first human case of Ebola Zaire has never been identified
overlap between victims is in Kitum Cave
Racal suit is a portable, positive-pressure space suit with battery-powered air supply
T-61: euthanasia agent
set out patches of paper saturated with spores of harmless bacterium known as Bacillus subtilis niger
a decon job that kills niger will kill almost anything
sunbeam electric frying pans are Army's tool of choice for decon job
electric frying pans cooked disinfecting crystals
crystals released formaldehyde gas as they boiled
leave gas in sealed off building for 3 days then check that the treatment killed the niger
Reston virus (monkey house) turns out to not kill humans even though it does infect them
likely that Reston outbreak started with single monkey in Philippines
kwisha = finished
Swahili word askari used to mean spear bearer; now it means an armed guard who carries an assault rifle and walks in your shadow

Brain Maker: The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brain–for Life, David Perlmutter
====
in nineteenth century Russian-born biologist Elie Mechnikov made link between longevity and healthy balance of bacteria in body
two most common groups of organisms in the gut, forming 90% of bacteria in colon, are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
firmicutes are fat-loving bacteria, equipped with more enzymes to digest complex carbs (more efficient at extracting energy); they increase fat absorption
obese people have elevated levels of firmicutes
two most studied strains of bacteria are Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus
Escherichia coli produces vitamin K but can cause severe illness
Heliobacter pylori causes peptic ulcers but regulates appetite
we're born with Clostridium dificile but it can grow unchecked based on diet
cytokines are small proteins released by cells that affect the behavior of other cells and are often important participants in inflammatory process
C-reactive protein, interleukin six (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor apha (TNF-a) are all cytokines
TNF-a elevated in inflammatory conditions such as Alzheimer's, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, and asthma
elevated blood sugar causes inflammation in the bloodstream and triggers reaction called glycation
glycation: biological process by which sugar binds to proteins and certain fats, resulting in deformed molecules
these sugar proteins are called advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
good gut bacteria are capable of producing important brain chemicals like BDNF, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate
BDNF is involved in neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are created
BDNF also protects existing neurons
Cyrex Array 2: gut permeability test that measures antibodies produced by immune system when confronted by molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
byproduct of mitochondria is production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aka free radicals
free radicals, known for negative effects of aging, also take part in apoptosis (process by which cells undergo self-destruction)
our fingers formed through apoptosis
apoptosis also allows our bodies to rid themselves of cancer cells
cells lacking a nucleus can still commit apoptosis; mitochondria determine whether a cell shall live or die
all of the mitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the female lineage
lower levels of BDNF have been associated with human anxiety and depression
serotonin synthesized from tryptophan
when tryptophan is degraded in body by certain enzymes, it becomes unavailable for production of serotonin
one of byproducts of degraded tryptophan is kynurenine so high levels of kynurenine are good indicator of low tryptophan levels
Bifidobacterium infantis associated with lower levels of kynurenine
people with autism tend to have higher levels of clostridial specials; people with autism tend to crave carbs, especially refined sugars
three main fatty acids produced by gut microbes are acetic, propionic, and butyric acid
clostridial species produce propionic acid (PPA) in abundance
PPA increases gut permeability
individuals with autism are typically deficient in glutathione

malar fat pad is cushion of youthful padding that sits high on your cheekbone
nineteenth century operating theaters were bad news for patient (more to do with medical instructions than saving patients' lives)
first operations under ether didn't take place until 1846
proctology helped pave way for surgery's acceptance as respectable branch of medicine
King Ptolemy I of Alexandrian Egypt circa 300 BC was first leader to deem it ok for medical types to cut open the dead for purpose of figuring out how bodies work
Herophilus first physician to dissect human bodies
he began dissecting live criminals
number of private anatomy schools flourish in England and Scotland in 18th, 19th century
from sixteenth century up until passage of Anatomy Act of 1886, only cadavers legally available for dissection in Britain where those of executed murderers
dissection as sentencing option for murderers was mandated in 1752 Britain
to gibbet is to dip a corpse in tar and suspend it in a flat iron cage (gibbet) in plain view of townsfolk while it rots and gets pecked apart by crows
competition with Paris schools where unclaimed corpses of poor who died at city hospitals could be used for dissection
by 1828 demands of London's anatomy schools were such that 10 full-time, 200 part-time people dedicated to body snatching throughout dissecting season (anatomy courses were held only between October and May to avoid rapid decomposition in warmer weather)
Burke and Hare kill people to sell their corpses
Burke hanged, Hare granted immunity
burke becomes synonym for smother
in ancient China, Confucian doctrine considered dissection a defilement of the human body and forbade its practice
this was a problem for Huang Ti, Father of Chinese Medicine, who around 2600 BC set out to write authoritative medical and anatomical text
even without dissection Huang Ti was able to figure out that blood of body is under control of the heart and the blood current flows in a continuous circle and never stops
Galen of Imperial Rome also never did a human dissection, but figured some things out through a bunch of animal dissections
Hippocrates also never dissected a human
Renassaince anatomist Belgian Andreas Vesalius got hands dirty in dissection
his book De Humani Corporis Fabrica is the most venerated anatomy book in history
1960s saw first heart transplant and passing of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, both of which raised awareness of need for organs for transplantation and of body donation as an option
around same time there was a notable increase in cost of funerals
The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford criticized funeral industry leading to upswing in cremation
potassium level of gel inside eyes is helpful during first 24 hours
algor mortis, cooling of dead body, also hepful
corposes lose about 1.5 deg F per hour until they reach the temperature of air around them
rigor mortis is more variable; starts a few hours after death, usually in head and neck, and continues down body disappearing anywhere from ten to forty-eight hours after death
if body has been dead longer than three days, investigators turn to entomological clues (age of fly larvae)
stages of decay
  fresh: involves autolysis (self-digestion)
  bloat: intestinal gas is waste product of bacteria metabolism. once dead, bodies don't expel gas and builds up causing bloat. small intestine is collapsed
         and sealed off. intestines eventually give way
  putrefaction/decay: digestive organs and lungs disintegrate first. brain liquefies next. up until about 3 weeks organs can be identified
skin slip, or gloving, is where skin will come off
by analyzing liquids of human decay in soil you can tell if a body has been moved. if the unique volatile fatty acids and compounds of human decay aren't there, the body didn't decompose there
aroma scan technology being developed for estimating time of death (electronic nose)
human remains dogs can pinpoint the location of a corpse at the bottom of a lake by sniffing water's surface for gases
eye caps invented by morticians to help dead people keep their eyes shut
first people known to attempt arterial embalming were trio of Dutch biologists and anatomists named Swammerdam, Ruysch, and Blanchard in late 1600s
intention was to preserve bodies to work around chronic shortage of bodies for dissection
arterial embalming didn't catch on until American Civil War
Thomas Holmes, father of embalming, sold his patented embalming fluid Innominata
cut carotid artery, insert cannula into artery connected by tubing to cannister of embalming fluid
embalming fluid contains red coloring to make skin look pink
water reverses chemical reactions of embalming
dead person = decedent
maximum amount a rib cage can compress without damaging internal organs is 2.75 inches
first Fords came without windshields, which is why drivers wore goggles
car windshields then had window glass and then tempered glass
cadavers used to determine force of impact of head against tempered glass
GM's first collapsible steering wheel shaft, introduced in the 1960s, cut the risk of death in a head-on collision by half
flail chest is a condition in which all your ribs break and your rib cage can't help inflate your lungs
electric cauterizing wand looks like cheap bank pen on cord, functions like a scalpel, cutting and burning (any vessels that are severed are melted shut)
ancient Egyptians believed the ka, the esssence of a person, resided in the heart; the heart was the only organ left inside a mummified corpse
Babylonians believed it resided in the liver
mellified man: dead human remains steeped in honey
macerate: soften in liquid
Jews would sell fake mummies in Alexandria
medical use of feces around since Pliny

Linux Kernel Development, Robert Love
====
3 main layers
  user-space
    applications

  kernel-space
    system call interface
    kernel subsystems
    device drivers

  hardware

each processor doing 1 of 3 things at any given moment:
  * in user-space, executing user code in a process
  * in kernel-space, in process context, executing on behalf of a specific process
  * in kernel-space, in interrupt context, not associated with process, handling an interrupt

major.minor.revision.stable (ex: 2.6.26.1)
minor odd -> development
minor even -> stable

kernel does not have access to libc or standard headers
kernel has its own equivalent of functions (ex: printk instead of printf)

use of inline functions for performance optimization (use sparingly; ex: static inline void wolf(unsigned long tail_size) )
use of inline assembly
branch annotation (ex: unlikely(error), likely(success) )
float point discouraged in kernel
small, fixed-size stack

task list: circular doubly linked list
each element is a process descriptor of type struct task_struct {
  unsigned long state
  int prio
  struct task_struct *parent
  struct list_head tasks
  pid
  ...
}
task_struct allocated via slab allocator
at the end of kernel stack of each process is the struct thread_info {
  struct task_struct *task
  struct exec_domain *exec_domain
  __u32 flags
  __u32 status
  __u32 cpu
  int preempt_count
  ...
}
current macro for process descriptor of currently executing task = current_thread_info()->task
process descriptor states
  TASK_RUNNING: process currently running or on runqueue (only state possible for process executing in user-space)
  TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping
  TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE: process is sleeping but doesn't wake up when signalled
  __TASK_TRACED: process is being traced
  __TASK_STOPPED: process has stopped; not running and not eligible to run
change task state with set_task_state(task, state)
all processes descendants of init process, whose PID is one
for_each_process() iterates over entire task list

linked list funkiness
list_for_each()
list_for_each_entry()
list_entry()

scheduler classes
  SCHED_NORMAL
    handled by CFS
    CFS uses the scheduler entity struct, struct sched_entity {
      ...
      on_rq
      ...
      vruntime
      ...
    }
    vruntime: amount of time spent running normalized by the number of runnable processes

process priority
  real-time (0 to 99)
  nice (-20 to 19)
