Some license plates of suspicious cars I've spotted at some point in time.

(NY unless otherwise stated)

use https://www.vehiclehistory.com/licence-plate-search/licence-plate.php

you need to look up the plate right after spotting it. they recycle it [to civvies] and it'll show up at a later time.

PLATES (random comments of note; I'm sure some of these are red herrings)
