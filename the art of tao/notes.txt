undeniable statistical anomalies
    major
        sutton st incident overhearing neighbors [Greenpoint]
        semen girl doing her little schtick (rosebud) [had she not done that I would've thought I was just schizophrenic and probably just killed myself (had a few close ones)] [Manhattan]
        the uber incident (uber pool in queens, picked up someone else a few blocks away, both of us dropped off on same block; dude in the car
            was incredibly nervous and happened to be one of the neighbors across the street with the weird van with the laser device) [Glen Oaks]
        dude at shitty corner bodega by the cliffs asking if my dad was Robert (looked like some CIA dude)
        bug spontaneously manifesting on my notebook in kitchen of Glen Oaks (I have no fucking clue about this one; never seen the type of bug before in my life) [Glen Oaks]
        google maps navigation being rerouted from pittsburgh to langley (didn't notice)
        faraday tent compromised [via laser] (surprise! just a stephen king book) (first showing bars when there weren't as a prank and then they actually got through the tent and I had reception inside it; I'd say the material was too thin for my prank but I determined reception was blocked out from the beginning thus the tent was compromised) [Glen Oaks]
        someone left a piece of stale bread on the side of my house [Glen Oaks]
        possession incident [San Jose, San Francisco]
    minor
        I said something bad was going to happen one night and then I went to key food
            dude in uber with police sticker was being a dick acting all disgruntled asking if I was going to key food trying to psych me out
            dude was a dick so I mockingly asked about his salary just to shut him up
        random occurrences related to things I've said/sung in my sleep (banana peel dropped by someone in car in front of me <==> always humming snes mario kart song in my sleep)
        burning from some shit they put on my dog [Franklin Square]
        shit hits the fan right before sending an email to cryptome

aliente = italian alien
nichians = alien mob
enter your house several times to visit, a little too close, have to tell them you need your space
(like italian families)

Slept in hotel in CT on way to Amherst, MA. (too tired)
"He's dreaming about our friends." (I didn't even know the people in the room next to me or their friends.)
"He's talking about our friends in his sleep."

What is the point of creating?
To destroy.
If there's nothing in between, then why bother?
-> Great Destroyer moment
