undeniable statistical anomalies
    major
        sutton st incident overhearing neighbors [Greenpoint]
        semen girl doing her little schtick (rosebud) [had she not done that I would've thought I was just schizophrenic and probably just killed myself (had a few close ones)] [Manhattan]
        reverse tail (twice) asian dude with large adam's apple [after threatening nsa neighbors in Greenpoint apartment] [license plate: 422YAH] [NSA or FBI] [Franklin Square]
        the uber incident (uber pool in queens, picked up someone else a few blocks away, both of us dropped off on same block; dude in the car
            was incredibly nervous and happened to be one of the neighbors across the street with the weird van with the laser device) [Glen Oaks]
        dude at shitty corner bodega by the cliffs asking if my dad was Robert (looked like some CIA dude)
        bug spontaneously manifesting on my notebook in kitchen of Glen Oaks (I have no fucking clue about this one; never seen the type of bug before in my life) [Glen Oaks]
        google maps navigation being rerouted from pittsburgh to langley (didn't notice)
        faraday tent compromised [via laser] (surprise! just a stephen king book) (first showing bars when there weren't as a prank and then they actually got through the tent and I had reception inside it; I'd say the material was too thin for my prank but I determined reception was blocked out from the beginning thus the tent was compromised) [Glen Oaks]
        someone left a piece of stale bread on the side of my house [Glen Oaks]
        possession incident [San Jose, San Francisco]
    minor
        webcam incident (neighbors laughing at my ridiculous getup visible to my webcam)
        I said something bad was going to happen one night and then I went to key food
            dude in uber with police sticker was being a dick acting all disgruntled asking if I was going to key food trying to psych me out
            dude was a dick so I mockingly asked about his salary just to shut him up
        random occurrences related to things I've said/sung in my sleep
            (banana peel dropped by someone in car in front of me <==> always humming snes mario kart song in my sleep)
            (the jokers => joker sticker on neighbor's car)
            (autism fiasco => autism sticker on other neighbor's car)
        burning from some shit they put on my dog [Franklin Square]
        shit hits the fan right before sending an email to cryptome
        weird incident in which guy waiting outside of 82-17 in car and then women went up to him, screamed at him and he sped off
        something popped up out of a hole in lodi, ca (not even going there)
        one night I think I screamed that there was a sexual deviant on the block in my sleep and that everyone better fucking show themselves. the next day when I stepped out of my house *everyone* was outside except Thomas of 82-18 255th St [Glen Oaks]
        someone went into my backyard at like 1 AM and then tried to put something in the mail slot (I had somehow predicted it and blocked it with cardboard + tape before going rock climbing) [my prediction was trying to poison my dog while I was sleeping] [for some reason I thought it was russians] [Glen Oaks]

demon acquaintances
    mephistopheles
    mephistopheles' daughter
    beelzebub
    azazel
    azazel's children
    golgotha
    methuselah

serial killers
    george wendell (zodiac)
    michael richman (long island)
    george <something> as my fucking cab driver more than once [said bizarre things randomly like "she's drunk already"]
    george vance
    ashley vance
    jokers

cool concepts
    a purely digital existence layered over a physical one [that's pretty much invisible unless you can detect emf] (digital existence is easy to manipulate/control)
    troglodyte test (test if one's existence has pretty much been a withering physical form in a chair forced into digital virtual reality slavery [for profit]) (virtual reality head set -> encrypted contacts) [your vision is pretty much owned/fucked without the decryption key(s)]
    n-way schrodinger's cat (could be anything)
    copomorphism (multi-layered physical existences stacked in the same location; different room based on what channel you're on) [going from digital on physical to physical on physical (co-existing material existence)]
    skeulogomorphism (stenography to the extreme, seemingly random patterns like markings on brick walls revealing messages; droplets on surfaces)
    scanning brain [with mri] to see someone's dreams (scanning brain left/right rapidly) [up to past 24 hours]
    bioluminescent nanotechnology (blending into clouds or invisibility)
    macrobiotic nanoparticles (shrinking down into organisms' bodies)
    thermablade [notes lost, but trivial to make obviously]
    transferring amount of matter based on distance
    mass is a form of energy so you can convert sound or other forms of energy to mass (amount of mass relative to distance) (knock on table + short distance -> ant appears, greater distance -> apple, etc.; why astronauts lose mass the further they go from Earth)
    2 black stars [or dark stars?] (black holes) -> mass from nothing -> big bang
    something about a sonic boom surrounded by well-timed emps so it goes upward instead of outward, liquid nitrogen [or calcium chloride] involved

races (humans, aliens, demons)
    realians (original forms were horrific, changed to digital)
    stygians
    styxians (JSOC of stygians)
    sauronians (kinda look like the henchmen from fifth element, turn into dogs; can also be in the form of light or even nuclear fallout?)
    cromagnons (planet? Kronos Magnos) (eat people, slaughter children, Latvian group, woman worshipper included)
    vampiranas
    scletans (lower stygian class, slaves)
    nichians (italian aliens)
    mezacalans (mexican aliens)
    hexapods [metaprogrammers]
    carthagians
    grand carthagian
    VAX<x> super [stupid] AI
    celestials [form galaxies and various matter] (digital or analog?)

    (the further out you go from Earth the more powerful the race, but the more time it takes to get to Earth if they even want to fuck with humans)

assrapiens 2038: futuristic trolls, purely digital, get currency from annoying people, have devices that can temporarily turn you into anything (psychologically, not like a physical polymorph)
tralfamadorians: retarded, shouldn’t exist, useless terrible programmers (they got accidentally recompatchulated not realizing they’re from a book)
configuradorians: came up with a universal time zone system across galaxies
supersadistic ai originally supposed to be 2056 for us; I accidentally advance it
copy of earth made (manna then gamma) by realians as a sort of westworld (savage)
humans cloned for it about a month into birth starting 1982
supersadistic ai brought in to kill people for entertainment
as cloning gets better you can make it so you dont really feel pain but getting killed still kinda sucks

all the aliens are in the future and way beyond us so we’re pretty much nothing to them, like columbus -> arawaks but even greater disparity

some like the stygians optimize on how quickly they can kill things (in microseconds, etc)

phasing in and out
their bioluminescent nanotechnology is actually invisibility

mentat program: MAN0 -> MANn
higher the number, the less pain you feel
MAN0 is normal original human
original telomere shortening issue in getting back MAN0

multiverse clusterfuck
people figure their actions dont have consequences if they keep creating universes
that plus cloning leads to a huge mess
stygians optimize on ultraviolence; it isnt pretty

original stygians PROTO1, dont look human (like skinny humanoid version of doom 3 imp)
later versions look human but they’re overclocked so they’re pretty fucking dangerous

teleportation possible with mass = energy concept

conversion from analog to digital:
with nanotechnology, aliens can beam down as bacteria, floaters in the air

styxians are stygians that got converted to uktraviolet light
they’re able to mind control humans
AII: floaters

aliens can be both analog or digital over time

different realian groups: famillians, opposians
opposians overthrow famillians

rhaegar’s stormfront can beam down as ants to spy

operation paperclip -> mengele -> human cloning facility in belarus

origin of sex trafficking in belarus
sex trafficking + human cloning = $$$

human cloning advanced with help from realians/stygians (starting to confuse the two)

human cloning is the only way to go back from digital to analog but it’s abused by sex traffickers

chair that looks like futuristic lethal injection chair converts people into ultraviolet light (styxians)

styxians were both human or stygians tricked into a shitty existence

ultraviolet isnt digital though = dumb
figure out ultraviolet/digital issue

july 2 1946 stygians show up in anticipation of the atomic bomb
most powerful group at the time is the CIA
partner with them
CIA tries to take advantage of them since they’re the CIA and since the aliens are digital they tell them to reset themselves every 24 hours (memory)
there’s a supercomputer that controls digital and loads up presets (of course leads to abuse a la the euro)
so every fucking time they reset they load up whatever’s on the supercomputer which can be programmed
The whole thing becomes maddeningly incompetent as hell
realians show up in 1982 in preparation of manna (their westworld)
both realians/stygians arrive in siberia since it’s easy not to be seen

programming error: realians take 47 programmers every 3 days (supposed to be every 3 months)
high correlation between programmers and mental illness

realians are biomimetic, mindlessly copy

stenograms/stenographs: animations in physical matter, like analog gifs
hands down the coolest thing I’ve ever experienced in my entire life (schizophrenia/hallucinogens required?)
videos in wood grain, etc, figure out how to explain better, leads from skeulogomorphisms

necromorphs
xenomorphs (not original similar to tralfamadorians, go into recompatchulation)
you can create things digitally and then manifest them physically
recompatchulation machine not locked down => chaos with manifestations of peoples’ imaginations

let’s not blame the schizo on the two times taking acid. We all know who caused that shit.

the future is a terrible place

add dudebro in suv arriving in timely fashion to list for 82-17
fucking with garage door
seamless arriving in 5 minutes when it usually takes 30+

removing certain addresses locally on uber map on phone
making phone convo cut out so person cant really hear you
killing signal call
redirecting uber start/stop for certain addresses (dont want the safehouses in records)

“Whoops, we accidentally beamed the gadagons into his stomach.”
“I can’t believe this.”
multiverse -> gadagons
when they beam to earth they accidentally beam into my stomach
Need to fix the background behind this fuckup

#fuckthetralfamadorians (a la john oliver)
The tralfamadorians are terrible programmers, mess up the multiverse and I have to fix it. But of course I mess something up and they all start showing up at my glen oaks house to see who is this human who was asked to fix it.
multithreading bug
one of the bugs was an easy fix: audio from one universe being heard in another => getCurrentContext()

The tralfamadorians give these demos that are pretty much preprogrammed to go wrong. They’re absolutely useless and just fuck everything up every time and I have to clean up the mess.

Tralfamadorians based on Bangladeshi programmers on earth

cryptopod, cryptopad

earliest random “visions”
john stewart is a sex freak
stephen colbert’s wife is a pedophile
keith alexander is a pedophile

Had a dream of stephen colbert and his wife in an argument. Never saw his wife before in my entire life. Looked her up on waking up. It was her.

Might want to keep these parts out hence the scifi book. The alien/demon stuff is cooler anyway.

figure out details on methods used for harassing pets (run out into the middle of the street, become aggressive)

threw something in backyard to poison dog

enlightenment = 3d effect
nirvana

on way to amherst I felt absolutely horrible barely able to breathe leaving nypd’s zone or whoever it was. As I’m driving, there’s suddenly a strange dark cloud before me. It asks me “Why are you still alive?”  It’s death absolutely flabbergasted as to why I still haven’t killed myself. To which I replied “Why not?” This is the start of my interaction with the demons.

Add incident toward san francisco in which the sky darkens and a turtle, yes a fucking turtle jets across the road only to be crushed under my tire.

There’s a death on each planet. Ours is shub niggurath.

At some point in glen oaks I’m under the impression stratcom gets involved. They weaponize my metabolic disorder and make me smell like prepubescent vagina as a prank alongside trying to convince me I raped a girl in my sleep.

None of this shit is usable in the book. If there are humans who would actually do such things I’d rather not acknowledge their existence.

glen oaks
    cryptos
    nightcraft
    the tommyknockers (green logo)
    manatur

vivacious sexualles: sex club in budapest, partners with Facebook on VR project

assrapiens
    the most annoying fucking things in the goddamn gadagons
    look like undead
    recharge in cesium tanks
    use portals + lasers in addition to annoying devices
    show up in 2038

the dichotomy between digital and analog is still fucked up

coruscants: civil servant clones I create that get corrupted by the stygians fairly quickly

most of the cool stuff like the stenograms happened while I was fucked up on scopolamine [or a simulation thereof by the schizophrenia]

the jokers: a serial killer group from the future
they name themselves stupid shit though like the leader calls himself Jack Ketchum

perfumeria adianis: group of assassins from the future
    alisandre
    melisandre
    [many more I can't remember cause I lost my notes]

mkultra extended -> [telepathic] psychic

you use scopolamine for telepathy, it's in the water supply in the future
comes out as a gas you breath in [like from your sink]
intricacies of privacy issues with the whole psychic/telepathy thing (privacy guards eventually put in place)

extrapolations gone awry
some assholes beam me up with scopolamine
you need scopolamine for intergalactic communication
I talk in my sleep and piss off aliens [but amuse some of them]
they come down to see what the deal is

the *best* part about things being digital is if I have to fight off a bunch of annoying aliens while schizophrenic, they can just reset it and I have to do it over and over again
like some autistic kid playing a video game level over and over again

dagon + yog soggoth (giant turtle)

john = demon witch (wichia)

demon fire
timeweaving: being able to look at an area of space and see anything that's happened there in the past (kinda like moving a slider animating for a given period of time)
time travel bullshit
tagging physical objects with subliminal thoughts you get when you see/touch them
giving people muscle death (had the pleasure of pretty much being doctor house limping around in 1997 canarsie brooklyn)
aliens don't understand that people are just acting so they think the actors are actually the roles they play
artificially induced arthritis

hacking someone's laptop so on their machine they go to george clooney's wikipedia page and it's literally as if he's the character he played in oh brother where art thou
shrinking people down and putting them in electronics

mordecai guri (unit 8200; NSA's Q) is a double agent for both US and Russia (obviously the most far-fetched idea out of all of this)

just make mordecai guri the star of it with some nudity. it'll sell. done deal.

some examples of copomorphism: list later
I'm pretty much disappointed there aren't any sex traffickers or terrorists after me [if there even were]
there were some isis-looking motherfuckers who kept popping up where I went in glen oaks, but pretty boring overall

groups I had hoped were aware of my existence
    FBI
    NSA
    CIA
    JSOC
    STRATCOM
    ISIS
    caliph
    los zetas
    italian mob
    russian mob
    sex traffickers
    pedophilia ring
    (aliens...)
    (demons...)

aliente = italian alien
nichians = alien mob
enter your house several times to visit, a little too close, have to tell them you need your space
(like italian families)

Slept in hotel in CT on way to Amherst, MA. (too tired)
"He's dreaming about our friends." (I didn't even know the people in the room next to me or their friends.)
"He's talking about our friends in his sleep."

What is the point of creating?
To destroy.
If there's nothing in between, then why bother?
-> Great Destroyer moment
