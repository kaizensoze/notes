I contacted you in the past through PGP stupidly not including my key to send a reply.
You can find it at https://joegallo.nyc/ but at this point I don't have the patience for
PGP...

At some point, whether through subconscious trolling or whatnot (I talk in my sleep), I got targeted
by some group (NSA/CIA/whatever/who really cares) and they followed me every place I went (I moved at
least once a year regardless of them). They targeted me with a minimum of AUTOLOUD, PHOTOANGLO, and
NIGHTWATCH.

They hammered a nail at all of my common spots in my apartment (36 Sutton St APT 3L) like the spot at
my bed where I slept [next to my wife] or where I sat down to use my laptop. I have a feeling this helped
them pinpoint where to point the PHOTOANGLO device. On the other hand, I really think this was more used
to help them tag me with possibly something other than the PHOTOANGLO device. Perhaps a subcutaneous diode
laser treatment device such as the Dornier Medilas H 20 I found sitting in a van in front of the house I'm
currently renting.

I'd move around the apartment with my laptop and they'd follow me, plugging in some device that they'd then
place on a shelf near the ceiling of their apartment. They'd repeatedly do this and I'd hear giggling
[presumably from the one manning the NIGHTWATCH device paired with the PHOTOANGLO device] as I continually
moved around the apartment.

They'd react to things I'd do on my laptop. One time I left my webcam uncovered, dressed up in this
ridiculous outfit, went to the computer, and suddenly heard suppressed giggling.

At some point after typing various things on my screen for them to presumably see (things like
"it's impolite to spy on your neighbors" etc.), I went to bed and after some commotion below I suddenly
felt a slight burning sensation right around where they hammered a nail a day or two prior. I stayed still
for a minute or two until deciding it was very much not psychosomatic and decided to get up and leave the
apartment, freaking out my wife.

From then on I started experiencing really bizarre schizophrenia-like symptoms. It was weird because I
went to a psych ward to get checked in just in case, they prescribed Risperidone, and it didn't do anything
other than make me fat. I've tried Geodon and Abilify. None of them do a goddamn thing. Each time I take a
given antipsychotic I experience different symptoms. Like one time I took my Geodon pill for the day and it
suddenly gave me really bad schizophrenia-like symptoms. The symptoms come and go. I know this is common for
schizophrenia that it comes and goes in cycles but we're talking like 11AM I feel schizo, 12PM I feel completely
fine, 3PM I feel high as fuck and I don't even smoke anything. I mention this to psychiatrists and their typical
response is "Um it's common for schizophrenia to take some time to go away, like after a few weeks, and then be
triggered at a later point in time due to stress or whatnot, but I have no idea what to tell you if you can
manifest schizophrenia and then have it suddenly go away like three times in a single day."

I get that this sounds absolutely ridiculous and it's unfortunate that like every other schizophrenic thinks
the latest and greatest technology that people don't completely know about is being used against them to
fuck with them. I mean the fact that I'm now informally associated with a group of people who believe in
stupid shit like they're being mind controlled or that there are lizard people walking among us is bad enough,
but like I said, my symptoms are really really weird. They come and go and when the symptoms kick in, shit
really hits the fan, like I suddenly have people following me on normally quiet streets as if they're trying
to scare the shit out of me. People randomly driving up to me, giving me this shit eating grin and driving
away.

There are a few people across the places I've lived who have stood out. I've lived in many different places
so seeing the same people in the vicinity across these places is pretty weird. Since people in the intelligence
community like to give codenames I've given them some codenames of my own. I'm pretty sure they're an NSA TAO
group. Again I haven't committed any crimes so I have no idea what I've done to piss them off [other than trolling
the shit out of them once I suspected I was being surveilled]. The group is in order of [presumable leadership].
Everyone in the NSA seems to be these really dorky looking grad students in hoodies (who figured?) I think at some
point I got other agencies involved by trolling with harassing google searches because some of my neighbors
started looking like feds. Feds are hilarious because their blatant clean cut appearance makes them totally look
like feds that I almost question what they're doing out of an office.
