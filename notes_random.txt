CRISPR (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY&feature=youtu.be)
====
bacteriophages (phages), which are a virus, hunt and kill bacteria by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over
the bacteria try to resist but fail most of the time
sometimes bacteria survive the phages and save a part of the virus dna in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR
when the virus attacks again, the bacteria quickly makes an RNA copy from CRISPR and arms protein CAS9
if the bacteria finds a match against the dna of the attacking virus, the DNA from CAS9 is activated and cuts out the virus DNA, protecting it from virus attack
scientists figured out the CRISPR system is programmable

tor
====
4 types of relays: guard (entry), middle, exit, bridge
a circuit consists of 3 nodes: a guard, a middle, and an exit
all links between nodes encrypted except exit node -> target machine
onion service = onion address
.onion addresses: 16 characters (base 32)
client and server hide their location
steps:
    onion service picks nodes and builds a circuit
    service uploads its onion service descriptor (text file that explains how to get to service) to an onion service directory (HSDirectory)
    user learns about the .onion (service) and fetches descriptor from the directory (creates circuit to random relay (rendezvous point))
    user tells the service to meet at rendezvous point
    service connects to rendezvous point
    user and service can now use circuit to exchange info
    there exist six HSDirs
    descriptor id is base16
future tor changes:
    add random value to descriptor generated hash
    change onion address from 16 to 52 characters
    guard node sets (to prevent knowing guard node by malicious middle node)
    onion balance: way to set up multiple identical hidden services
onion security:
    dont run relays on onion servers
    use unix sockets and avoid tcp altogether

to figure out key conversions:
    a flat is -1, a sharp is +1
    C -> C#: +7
    C -> Cb: -7

caduceus vs rod of asclepius
====
The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, eloquence, trickery, and negotiation.
Tangential association of the caduceus with medicine has occurred through the ages, where it was sometimes associated with alchemy and wisdom.
The modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.

limitless worker surveillance
====
in Feb 1855 Allan Pinkerton met with attorney Edward Rucker at Chicago Masonic Hall to discuss need for greater control over employees
they decided to form Pinkerton National Detective Agency
The Pinkertons served role of infiltrating/busting unions and monitoring workers
Congress later passes Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 which limited federal government's ability to hire Pinkertons (private employers still could)
