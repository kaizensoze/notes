  Schizophrenic psychopath, at your service.
  Everytime I masturbate an angel loses its wings. -> That's not even original.
  You raped my wife in your sleep every night you were in that apartment.
  Everytime you rape a little girl in your sleep, we're gonna fuck you in the ass.
  You raped a little girl in your sleep, Joe. Yes you did. She heard you and she killed herself. The neighbors called the cops and we had to intervene. (plays back audio of parents screaming and sirens)
  (list various pranks)
  Joe, we told you you don't have schizophrenia. This is what schizophrenia is like (cue schizo symptoms). Symptoms then fade away.
  You had cancer Joe. Stage 4. We removed it.
  You have cancer, Joe. It's really bad. You need to go to the hospital right now.
  You're a psychopath now. We can't help you. We have to kill you. I'm really sorry. You're going to go to bed and not wake up. You'll go into a coma.
  We know everything about you.
  Whenever you take initiative, you will regret it.
  If you see something and say something I hope it was worth it.
  We raped your mom, your sister, and your wife and you don't even care. You're a psychopath now.
