week 1
======
train/dev/test
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
RNNs better for
ReLU function
    Rectified (taking max of 0)
    Linear
    Unit
Supervised Learning

standard NN for basic structured data
CNN for something like photo tagging
RNN for sequence data like over time sequence (Audio, Language)

structured data vs unstructured data (audio, image, text)

the more data the better the performance of the algorithm
amount of labeled data is m
you can say the number of samples or the sample size is m

algorithm switched from a sigmoid function to a ReLU function

interview with Geoffrey Hinton
