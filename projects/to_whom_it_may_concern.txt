To Whom It May Concern

sign up
login
gmail-like inbox shown
start intro sequence (just joined a company, etc.)
message can contain text and image (1 image only)
you can't immediately see image. there's an icon you tap to view it (press and hold)
you have to scroll to bottom of text before you can tap image icon to view image
the idea is to read the text first without seeing the images to hopefully up the comedic factor
when viewing a message, you can flag, burn, bump, star
you can also delete a message from messages list view (inbox)
a bump will trigger an additional distribution to other users
5 tabs?: inbox, sent, drafts, top n, favorites
no moderation

have a max number of unread messages (10) in inbox so people don't freak out about bandwidth issues

have an initial max view count for each sent message (set it to a % of [logged in] users?) => tie message's reach to user, not message
an upvote increases the max view count

buttons: flag burn bump star

show user's bump count next to their username in messages
make a user's message's reach proportional to their bump count

when you sign up, there's a scripted part (reserved messages) as if you're starting at a company that will segue into "open world" mode
the last "reserved" message (reserved = authored by admin and sent to every user) will be the supposed IT guy of the company who starts his message with
To Whom It May Concern, and the message states that he's had enough and he's out

act as if everyone works at the company
have the user shown as <username>@<made_up_company>

allow direct (private) emails?

to prevent abuse of content, only allow images shot directly from phone (disallow access to photos on device)

writing a long message on the phone can be a pain so allow a web interface that allows saving a draft (no image upload) that you can access from your phone?

TODO: decide on UI: inbox, sent, top n, favorites
TODO: figure out distribution algorithm

LATER: allow users to pay to increase their messages' reach
LATER: restrict messages in inbox to those created by users nearby? (no restriction on global top list though)
