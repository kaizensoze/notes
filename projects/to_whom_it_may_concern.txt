To Whom It May Concern

you have an inbox
you're given some "account" with a random ridiculous name -> you pick username (people would get butt-hurt over messages coming from an unverified seemingly legit name)
maybe allow username + name?
initial message explaining what to do, etc.
your inbox gets random [but hopefully interesting messages] from strangers
message can contain text and image (1 image only)
you can't immediately see image. there's an icon you tap to view it (press and hold)
you have to scroll to bottom of text before you can tap image icon to view image
the idea is to read the text first without seeing the images to hopefully up the comedic factor
when viewing a message, you can rate it -> upvote/downvote
there'll also be a flag option
you can delete a message
basically a way to get interesting messages from random people
an upvote will trigger an additional distribution to other users ( + additional 1% of users?)
3 tabs: inbox, sent, top n
update top n list every day/[week]/month? -> update top n in real-time
no moderation

have a max number of unread messages in inbox so people don't freak out about bandwidth issues

eventually have sponsored messages
only record up/downvotes in general
for sponsored messages, record message open, image open

have an initial max view count for each sent message (set it to a % of [logged in] users?) => tie message's reach to user, not message
an upvote increases the max view count

might want to have a favorite option with a favorites tab

buttons: flag burn bump star

show user's bump count next to their username in messages
make a user's message's reach proportional to their bump count

when you sign up, there's a scripted part (reserved messages) as if you're starting at a company that will segue into "open world" mode
the last "reserved" message (reserved = authored by admin and sent to every user) will be the supposed IT guy of the company who starts his message with
To Whom It May Concern, and the message states that he's had enough and he's out

act as if everyone works at the company
have the user shown as <username>@brassafrax.com

allow direct (private) emails?

to prevent abuse of content, only allow images shot directly from phone (disallow access to photos on device)

writing a long message on the phone can be a pain so allow a web interface that allows saving a draft (no image upload) that you can access from your phone?

TODO: need to think about distribution algorithm
TODO: look into shorter name for app
TODO: purchase domain name

LATER: allow users to pay to increase their messages' reach
LATER: restrict messages in inbox to those created by users nearby? (no restriction on global top list though)
