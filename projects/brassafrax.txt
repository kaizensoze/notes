don't really care about making it employer/recruiter friendly
goal is to hone your craft and to find other people to work with to hopefully incentivize that
list of a user's past projects isn't public
only published projects are public (they go in a user's portfolio section)
at a certain point you lock a project down when you're satisfied with the result and publish it
if you want to continue working on it, you can fork it outside of the site
one project at a time
no general chat
might be a better idea to not have a shit list
profile sections (searchable keywords)
  skills
  interests
vote to publish?
user can choose not to link to a published project in their portfolio
projects in a portfolio would be sorted by stars, publish_date?
for a published project, list forks and their stars?
option to start session from a fork or from scratch

LATER
  make master branch protected by default if necessary
  allow people to submit project ideas
  if you don't have an idea for a project, you can pick a random suggested idea to get you started

TODO
  think of the many different uses cases for this product
    joining random group
    inviting user(s) to start a group
    interactive teaching session (publish tutorial at the end) [will require easy mass invite?]
  should users who join a sesion immediately have write access?

  come up with a better name for project
  figure out how publishing a project should work (https://pages.github.com/)
