questions
  Is the X-On-Behalf-Of header being used?                                      // not for now, maybe later down the road
  If so, where does the email come from for "X-On-Behalf-Of: <email>"?          // not used for now
  JWT token is good for 12 hours so should user be logged out every 12 hours?
  How do I get rid?
