questions
  What should the Availability subsection look like for an already scheduled advisor?
  What's the difference between SEND CONFIRMATION and EMAIL buttons?
  JWT token is good for 12 hours so should user be logged out every 12 hours?
	answered:
		advisors are moved from one action to the next (not cumulative)
		advisors can only go from one action to the next (disallow skipping steps)
		Declined means the advisor declined instead of accepting
		the status progression is in 2 directions
