questions
  What is the number in parentheses for Last sent on?
  Is the last line in the first section of the advisor detail view always the last sent on date?
  What's the difference between SEND CONFIRMATION and EMAIL buttons?
  JWT token is good for 12 hours so should user be logged out every 12 hours?
  Is the X-On-Behalf-Of header being used?                                      // not for now, maybe later down the road
  If so, where does the email come from for "X-On-Behalf-Of: <email>"?          // not used for now
