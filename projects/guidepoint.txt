questions
  What's the typical API workflow?
  Is the X-On-Behalf-Of header being used?                                      // not for now, maybe later down the road
  If so, where does the email come from for "X-On-Behalf-Of: <email>"?          // not used for now
  JWT token is good for 12 hours so should user be logged out every 12 hours?
  /meeting/{id} => meeting id?
  What's the difference between /request/{id} and /casecode/{id}/request?
  Is the summary correct for SubmitComplianceAction, GetComplianceNotes,
  GetComplianceOfficers?
  What's the difference between /request/{id}/advisor/{id}/compliance_action
  and /request/{id}/advisor/{id}/compliance_notes?
