* clarification on device id association and if we absolutely cannot start from scratch with swift

A.) What technologies they are and aren’t using now. Realm / SQL Lite, et al
B.) What data they have now to persist logins  and make it clear its not possible to do this if they don’t have the token to device IDs on the server..
C.) What exactly would need to be ported or not from the legacy codebase
D.) How we’re going to handle the data layer and data caching approach.

after meeting
1.) Whether we still recommend starting from scratch?  (I think we will)
2.) Whether we have solutions to meet their requirements?  (In some cases we may not)
3.) Whether its all in scope or not.
