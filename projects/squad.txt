don't really care about making it employer/recruiter friendly
goal is to hone your craft and find other people to work with
list of a user's past projects isn't public
only published projects are public (they go in a user's portfolio section)
at a certain point you lock a project down when you're satisfied with the result and publish it
if you want to continue working on it, you can fork it outside of the site
one project at a time
no general chat
