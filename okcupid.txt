I'm going to rape you.
I'm a pedophile.

Sometimes I like to make poor life choices and break out the mentos.
how each US state could pretty much be its own country.
blinking offensive things at people.

There should really be a way to provide a template [a la github] that shows up when someone goes to send you a message so that there isn't this sort of breaking of the fourth wall where people add notes to their profile based on messages they've received, like "*** No I'm not into threesomes. ***" or "*** Sorry, but I'm not into BDSM. ***". This way I don't have to be aware of all the stupid shit members of my sex send to those of the opposite one.
