Hi,

I know this is a little direct, but would you want to grab a coffee sometime next week?

My dog Willy is pretty chill; though, sometimes he can be a real grouch.
Currently renting a house in Glen Oaks on the border of Queens and Nassau. Kinda chill, kinda boring.
Sometimes I like to make poor life choices and break out the mentos.
how each US state could pretty much be its own country.
blinking offensive things at people.
Henrietta and the Majesticals. Just putting that out there. (Should I go with "majesticals" or "majesticles"?)
There should really be a way to provide a template [a la github] that shows up when someone goes to send you a message so that there isn't this sort of breaking of the fourth wall where people add notes to their profile based on messages they've received, like "*** No I'm not into threesomes. ***" or "*** Sorry, but I'm not into BDSM. ***". This way I don't have to be aware of all the stupid shit members of my sex send to those of the opposite one.
