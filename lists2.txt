cell phone simulators
====
Harris: Triggerfish -> StingRay -> Hailstorm
countermeasures: Android:SnoopSnitch, ESD:CryptoPhone
In theory IMSI catchers can pinpoint only the location of 3G/4G phones so the trick is to knock them down to 2G to access calls/texts/etc., which is what Hailstorm does.

Quotes
====
"I feel like my main quest is a side quest."

“It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.”
Ursula K. Le Guin. “The Left Hand of Darkness.”

"This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted. They are treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry." - This Is Spinal Tap

"I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter tied to this fucking couch." - The Thing

"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how."
Nietzsche

"It is the good fortune of many to live distant from the scene of sorrow.”
Thomas Paine. “Common Sense.”

"Don't you do it, Hitler. Don't you dare fall in love with me." - Parks and Recreation S05E08

"Most people shoot for happiness but feel formed through suffering."
The Road to Character - David Brooks

"A date is an experience you have with another person that makes you appreciate being alone."
Larry David

“That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.”

Excerpt From: Charles Bukowski. “Women.” iBooks.

"I don't know what you're doing below 14th street, but it doesn't' matter." (You can't hide behind art.)
Lorne Michaels

"Sarcastically, I'm in charge."
Black Dynamite
